sw4519.dff	1	A	Your turn
sw4519.dff	2	B	I start
sw4519.dff	2	B	Okay
sw4519.dff	2	B	we keep a budget to an extent
sw4519.dff	2	B	and we were really forced into keeping a budget because I'm paid once a month which sort of forces some restrictions and you need to make sure all your bills are paid
sw4519.dff	2	B	about yourself
sw4519.dff	3	A	I have to say I really don't have a budget
sw4519.dff	3	A	Both my wife and I grew up in families of rather modest means and our family income at this point is comfortable
sw4519.dff	3	A	Upper middle class I guess you might say
sw4519.dff	3	A	And we're both so frugal that we really don't need a budget We just sort of invest the money and go on vacations and always never seem to have any money problems which I guess is a comfortable thing
sw4519.dff	4	B	I guess that really is (sort) (of) keeping a budget (You) (stay) (within) (your)
sw4519.dff	5	A	we stay within our means but we
sw4519.dff	6	B	(within) (your) (means)
sw4519.dff	7	A	don't do it by conscious effort
sw4519.dff	7	A	It just sort of happens automatically
sw4519.dff	9	A	we just moved to California and the cost of living here in California is (I) (would) (say) rather pathological
sw4519.dff	10	B	(Yes)
sw4519.dff	11	A	housing prices are from four to ten times more expensive than they were where I came from in Dallas
sw4519.dff	12	B	you moved from Dallas to San Francisco
sw4519.dff	13	A	(So)
sw4519.dff	14	B	That is a hugh difference
sw4519.dff	15	A	that presents a real shock
sw4519.dff	17	A	actually our standard of living has gone down somewhat since we've moved to California (but)
sw4519.dff	18	B	But you have good sour dough and it's a beautiful place to live
sw4519.dff	19	A	It's God's country
sw4519.dff	21	A	and one way you know that is that only God can afford it
sw4519.dff	23	A	so budget is not a problem for us
sw4519.dff	23	A	at least it hasn't been
sw4519.dff	23	A	It may be at this point
sw4519.dff	23	A	But (up) (until) (this) (point) it really hasn't been
sw4519.dff	23	A	When I was in undergraduate school a (long) long time ago I noted that the starting average monthly salary for engineers (you) (know) in my discipline was like six hundred ten dollars a month or something like that
sw4519.dff	25	A	And I noted at that point that (you) (know) if that's what my salary was that I drew then I would be making almost twice as much as my father made during his best year ever
sw4519.dff	25	A	So I stopped worrying about money
sw4519.dff	27	A	And (it) never have worried about money since then
sw4519.dff	28	B	(that's) (a) (system) (too)
sw4519.dff	29	A	Sometimes it's a bit of a problem because (I) (guess) I don't really manage my money the way I should
sw4519.dff	29	A	But I suppose I've lost money on not taking good advantage of investments (but)
sw4519.dff	30	B	then again you said you are able to take trips
sw4519.dff	30	B	And you do obviously have enough to live on so I guess you're indirectly budgeting
sw4519.dff	32	B	(just) bye-bye (the) (fact) (that) you said you're both very frugal in spending the money
sw4519.dff	32	B	So that's a form of budgeting I would think
sw4519.dff	32	B	it's kind of a strange topic for two people who don't really have a budget to talk about budgeting and how they manage their money
sw4519.dff	33	A	I guess we're both lucky in that regard then
sw4519.dff	35	A	How big is your family
sw4519.dff	36	B	(we) (have) (one) (on) (the) (way)
sw4519.dff	37	A	(I) (see)
sw4519.dff	38	B	my wife and then we're having one on the way in September
sw4519.dff	39	A	(how) once you get ten children though (you) (may) (have)
sw4519.dff	40	B	No I think it's just going to be one
sw4519.dff	41	A	(all)
sw4519.dff	42	B	How about yourself
sw4519.dff	43	A	I have two kids
sw4519.dff	43	A	one
sw4519.dff	45	A	nine and one thirteen and they are beginning to be a budget problem but have not been really up to this point
sw4519.dff	46	B	Do they budget at all
sw4519.dff	46	B	do you have them on an allowance
sw4519.dff	47	A	I give them an allowance (and) (they) I basically give my son ten dollars a week and I put half of it in the bank and I give him the other half in cold cash
sw4519.dff	49	A	And he has a teller card so he can do what he wishes with the money that I put in the bank
sw4519.dff	49	A	But at least it isn't burning a hole in his pocket
sw4548.dff	3	A	I don't think I'm in the majority in Texas (I) (don't) (think) (I) (agree) (with)
sw4548.dff	4	B	(really)
sw4548.dff	5	A	(No)
sw4548.dff	6	B	You don't believe in it
sw4548.dff	7	A	I wouldn't say that
sw4548.dff	7	A	I think I would have said that a few years ago
sw4548.dff	9	A	When I was younger I thought it was a sign of a civilized society if you didn't have capital punishment but maybe slowly changing my opinion
sw4548.dff	11	A	I'm not thoroughly opposed to it
sw4548.dff	11	A	I still think it's sort of true that a more civilized society wouldn't have to use capital punishment but I'm beginning to believe this is less civilized society than I thought
sw4548.dff	12	B	You sound a lot like a friend of mine
sw4548.dff	12	B	(A)
sw4548.dff	14	B	(a) (girl) (I) (hang) (out) (with)
sw4548.dff	14	B	She has (very) very black and white opinions There's no gray in her opinions She (she) probably would agree more with you but (but) (I) (don't) (know)
sw4548.dff	14	B	I think I would rather a person go ahead and be put down than give them the opportunity to get out and do it again
sw4548.dff	14	B	I've never had a (a) punishment or a (a) crime like a murder touch my immediate family
sw4548.dff	16	B	but I still feel very strongly that capital punishment is a good way to punish especially criminals who seem to have absolutely no remorse for what they've done
sw4548.dff	18	B	And we see that more and more
sw4548.dff	18	B	in our state now there's a fourteen year old boy who raped and then killed a seven year old girl
sw4548.dff	20	B	(that's) (fourteen) (years) (old)
sw4548.dff	20	B	What's he going to be doing when he turns into an adult
sw4548.dff	21	A	I certainly don't advocate turning people like that loose
sw4548.dff	23	A	I'm not sure executing them does anymore than keeping them in jail (but)
sw4548.dff	24	B	No it doesn't but
sw4548.dff	26	B	it costs less
sw4548.dff	27	A	that's a factor
sw4548.dff	28	B	And to me it is
sw4548.dff	28	B	I work and I pay my taxes and I lived out in Texas for a little while and (they're) (and) that's a pretty heavy state compared to Georgia
sw4548.dff	28	B	you guys are a lot more (for) to each his own even than we are in Georgia
sw4548.dff	30	B	But even in Georgia that's the attitude for the most part
sw4548.dff	30	B	If I work and pay my dues
sw4548.dff	32	B	you work and pay your dues and we'd get along just fine
sw4548.dff	34	B	(But) (when) (I've) (got) (to) (work) (to) (pay) (my) (dues) (and) (your) (dues)
sw4548.dff	36	B	(then) (I) (don't) (like) (you) (very) (much) (anymore)
sw4548.dff	37	A	(I) the cost is something but (but) (I) (think) it's relatively unimportant compared to what's the most effective way of
sw4548.dff	39	A	dealing with crime (and) (I) (guess) (I) (would) (like) (I) (don't) (know) (the) (European) (countries) (certainly) (none) (of) (them) (have) (capital) (punishment) (and) (they)
sw4548.dff	40	B	(really)
sw4548.dff	41	A	they don't have a crime problem either
sw4548.dff	41	A	(No) (you) (can't) they don't execute anybody in Britain or France and I don't believe they do in Germany or Italy either (and) (they) (don't) (have) (the) (crime) (problems) (we) (do)
sw4548.dff	41	A	I don't (really) think that there is too much of a relationship between the two
sw4548.dff	43	A	(I) (guess) what worries me about capital punishment is when I see people enthusiastic about it and sort of bloodthirsty
sw4548.dff	43	A	I think it brings out the worst in (the) people who do the punishing and that bothers me
sw4548.dff	44	B	(You) (might) (be)
sw4548.dff	45	A	(But) (it) (but)
sw4548.dff	46	B	I'd hate to be the person to pull the switch
sw4548.dff	48	B	I would never in a million years want that job
sw4548.dff	50	B	but I do believe it's necessary and I
sw4548.dff	52	B	On the one hand (I) (guess) I admire the person who has the guts to do it because I couldn't
sw4548.dff	54	B	(I) (couldn't) stand behind a gun and shoot somebody for nothing and I couldn't pull the switch (but)
sw4548.dff	55	A	(I) (wha-) the other thing that bothers me is when it becomes a political issue because I don't really think it's a very important aspect of fighting crime or law and order (or) (anything) else
sw4548.dff	55	A	(I) (think) it just becomes a symbolic I'm tougher than you are type of emotional issue for politicians (so)
sw4548.dff	57	A	I would like for it to be settled once for all and get in the background while the more important issues get discussed
sw4548.dff	59	A	(Like) (I) (said) some years ago (I) (think) I would have said there's no place for capital punishment in the
sw4548.dff	61	A	civilized western country
sw4548.dff	63	A	Now I'm not so sure of that
sw4548.dff	63	A	I wouldn't vote against somebody just because it was for capital punishment and
sw4548.dff	64	B	(What)
sw4548.dff	65	A	nor the other way around
sw4548.dff	66	B	what's making you become more convinced that it might be a good way of punishing
sw4548.dff	67	A	(I) (guess) (I'm) (my) (view) (of) (my) I'm beginning to believe that some people are simply not rehabilitatable and that
sw4548.dff	69	A	costs and other factors justify executing people
sw4548.dff	71	A	Maybe it's more a symbolic gesture than anything else and I've also never been a victim although I have two friends whose wives were murdered and
sw4548.dff	72	B	(gosh)
sw4548.dff	73	A	I can imagine that for some people it would be the only form of justice in that case
sw4548.dff	74	B	(yes) if it ever touched my fam-
sw4565.dff	1	A	(I) in this modern day and age it seems like we have more and more leisure time because we have so many appliances (and) (whatnot)
sw4565.dff	1	A	We don't even have to cook dinner anymore
sw4565.dff	2	B	(Yes)
sw4565.dff	2	B	(really)
sw4565.dff	3	A	but (I)
sw4565.dff	5	A	I've heard I don't know this for a fact but I've heard that a lot of families really don't spend a great deal of time together
sw4565.dff	5	A	(That) (ki-) the kids maybe on the average get something like thirty seconds of quality time with the parents
sw4565.dff	6	B	(That's) (what) (I've) (heard) (too)
sw4565.dff	7	A	It seems bizarre to me
sw4565.dff	7	A	I don't quite understand it although I think probably the worst thing that's happening at least the modern world today is television
sw4565.dff	9	A	Not so much because it's bad per se although there is some pretty crappy programming and there's also some (I) (think) poorer lifestyles illustrated but simply because it dominates so much discussionary time
sw4565.dff	11	A	It's so darned easy to turn the thing on
sw4565.dff	12	B	I know it
sw4565.dff	12	B	I tell myself sometimes just sit down after work
sw4565.dff	13	A	So I refuse to have one in the house
sw4565.dff	14	B	(really)
sw4565.dff	16	B	good for you
sw4565.dff	16	B	(Good) (for) (you)
sw4565.dff	16	B	I talk to a lot of people about that and I've thought about it myself (and) (I) (though) (about) (it) (a) (lot)
sw4565.dff	18	B	But I still haven't done it yet
sw4565.dff	18	B	that's good
sw4565.dff	19	A	I'll tell you
sw4565.dff	19	A	Television sure makes child rearing easy on you
sw4565.dff	19	A	the kids can be a real pest and turning the T V on is almost like magic it's like sticking an electrode into their pleasure center and you don't have to worry about them
sw4565.dff	20	B	(That's) (true) I've noticed that
sw4565.dff	21	A	But I don't think it's too good
sw4565.dff	22	B	I don't think so either
sw4565.dff	23	A	(so) (I) (don't) (know) (I) (take) (advantage) I don't have a great deal of time to spend with the kids but I take advantage of dinner time
sw4565.dff	23	A	We always eat together and whenever you're with your kids you want to interact with them rather than just ignore them
sw4565.dff	24	B	Do you keep your kids active in sports or anything (or)
sw4565.dff	25	A	(I) (guess) our big outlet is music
sw4565.dff	26	B	(okay)
sw4565.dff	27	A	our thirteen year old son plays violin and our
sw4565.dff	29	A	nine year old daughter plays cello
sw4565.dff	30	B	(Okay)
sw4565.dff	31	A	and when our son started playing violin I took up violin and when our daughter started playing cello I took up cello
sw4565.dff	33	A	So there's plenty of interactive time in practicing
sw4565.dff	33	A	Although neither kid likes to practice
sw4565.dff	35	A	(I) (guess) that's not a big surprise
sw4565.dff	36	B	(No)
sw4565.dff	36	B	(Not) (for) (kids)
sw4565.dff	37	A	But I imagine with infants most of your time is (sort) (of) spent taking care of them rather than interacting with them
sw4565.dff	39	A	(Although)
sw4565.dff	40	B	I try and read to them and I take them to the park and stuff (and)
sw4565.dff	41	A	reading is so good
sw4565.dff	43	A	I took great pleasure in reading to my kids when they were little and I still try to read to them although our son is not liking that anymore
sw4565.dff	44	B	they get to that stage
sw4565.dff	45	A	(but) (I) (read) there's this DOCTOR SEUSS sleep book
sw4565.dff	45	A	Have you ever seen that yet
sw4565.dff	46	B	Sleep book no
sw4565.dff	47	A	(it's) (called) (a) (sleep) (book) (and) you ought to get it
sw4565.dff	47	A	I tell you I read that book to my kids so many times I almost have the thing memorized
sw4565.dff	50	B	We've got quite a few of DOCTOR SEUSS' books
sw4565.dff	51	A	I think his sleep book is my favorite
sw4565.dff	52	B	really
sw4565.dff	54	B	I like to do it and they enjoy reading
sw4565.dff	54	B	actually I never read a lot growing up and I never read until a few years ago I just started picking up books and so I've found that it's really important to me to get to read
sw4565.dff	54	B	I like to get away in a book
sw4565.dff	56	B	And so I've put a lot more emphasis on that on my kids
sw4565.dff	57	A	(So) (how)
sw4565.dff	58	B	to try and
sw4572.dff	1	A	what things do you consider an invasion of privacy
sw4572.dff	2	B	(I) (don't) (know)
sw4572.dff	2	B	What do you think
sw4572.dff	3	A	(I) (don't) (know)
sw4572.dff	3	A	I had a little bit more time to think about it
sw4572.dff	3	A	(I) (was) (thinking) (of) (I) (don't) (know) I started to think about all the big data bases they have with all the information about you on them like the credit reports
sw4572.dff	5	A	and all those demographics studies that they do that have who knows how much stuff about all the purchases that you've made and everything kept tract somewhere and I don't (know) (I) (don't) (know) what they actually have in there but
sw4572.dff	7	A	I know I mean they sell those
sw4572.dff	8	B	what about required drug testing as a condition of employment
sw4572.dff	9	A	that was the other one I was thinking of
sw4572.dff	9	A	(I) (think) (that's) I know drugs are illegal
sw4572.dff	10	B	(It) (thing) (actually)
sw4572.dff	10	B	I have worked at Texas Instruments
sw4572.dff	12	B	And they instituted a Drug testing policy where they randomly would test employees
sw4572.dff	14	B	and (to) (tell) (you) (the) (truth) I really did not think much about it
sw4572.dff	14	B	(I) (hadn't) it really didn't relate to me
sw4572.dff	14	B	But there were some things that people brought up like what happens if they get a false positive what recourse do you have
sw4572.dff	16	B	(And) also this is against the law for the government to do this kind of big brother activity and yet a lot of these large corporations such as Texas Instruments although they don't admit to it actually a drug testing policy comes about as a result of government pressure
sw4572.dff	18	B	So what that means is to me that really it's the government that's requiring this although they don't actually execute it themselves it's really the government (that)
sw4572.dff	18	B	So in that sense at least philosophically it's really borderline legal
sw4572.dff	19	A	I think that a person's competence should be more determined by their actions and their behavior and (you) (know) if they're on some kind of controlled substance then it kinds of takes away from the job of the supervisor or manager type person who is able to evaluate them
sw4572.dff	19	A	I think they should be evaluated that way rather than with (you) (know) a chemical
sw4572.dff	20	B	what about this AIDS epidemic now
sw4572.dff	20	B	Where you find that certain people actually are criminal in their disregard for it-
sw4572.dff	21	A	These people that are carriers (and) (don't)
sw4572.dff	22	B	(others)
sw4572.dff	22	B	(and)
sw4572.dff	23	A	(that) (don't) reveal it
sw4572.dff	24	B	(and) of course the ultimate solution is to operate on their brain so that it doesn't
sw4572.dff	26	B	it destroys their libido
sw4572.dff	27	A	that would be kind of an extreme
sw4572.dff	28	B	(if) (they) (ever)
sw4572.dff	29	A	I've heard of things like (you) (know) marking them somehow (you) (know) (or) (something) (like) (that) or putting them all someplace (like) (in) (a) (kind) (of)
sw4572.dff	30	B	(So) what about that as an invasion of privacy
sw4572.dff	31	A	(I) (guess) it (kind) (of) borders on (I) (mean) what do you value more
sw4572.dff	31	A	The invasion of the person's privacy or the possible danger to other people
sw4572.dff	32	B	(So) (really) it gets to balancing personal freedom against the general welfare
sw4572.dff	34	B	of society
sw4572.dff	35	A	(I) (guess) that's been the big role of government (I) (guess)
sw4572.dff	35	A	generally
sw4572.dff	36	B	(it's) (supposed) (to) (have) (been)
sw4572.dff	37	A	that's (kind) (of) a difficult one to go into
sw4572.dff	37	A	(I) (mean) that particular case
sw4572.dff	38	B	(No) (it)
sw4572.dff	39	A	Because there's a lot of people that they could require obligatory AIDS testing for everyone because (you) (know) there's a huge part of the population (not) (a) (huge) (part) (but) (a)
sw4572.dff	40	B	A growing part
sw4572.dff	41	A	the AIDS population (I) (guess) that have it that don't know they do
sw4572.dff	43	A	are spreading it
sw4572.dff	43	A	But (again) to require such a test (and) (then) (to) (make) (it) is to subject them to discriminatory practices and other things
sw4572.dff	43	A	I don't know (I) (don't) (know) how exactly I feel about that
sw4572.dff	44	B	Maybe chop their weenies off
sw4603.dff	1	B	(Okay)
sw4603.dff	1	B	(Go) (ahead)
sw4603.dff	2	A	I think public service is a worthy thing (and) (as) (a) (matter) (of) (fact) there are a lot of programs such as Peace Corps that promote that
sw4603.dff	4	A	Probably the most popular one but one that is not typically recognized as such is the Boy Scouts
sw4603.dff	6	A	I know that because my son is a scout now and is thinking about his Eagle (and) in order to get Eagle you have to have merit badges in citizenship in the community
sw4603.dff	8	A	(citizenship) (in) (the) nation (citizenship) (in) (the) world and you have to do a public service project
sw4603.dff	10	A	in which leadership is the key element
sw4603.dff	10	A	I think the question is posed (somewhat) strangely because it's talking about a requirement for
sw4603.dff	12	A	public service and (of) (course) the Peace Corps the Boy Scouts is a voluntary activity
sw4603.dff	15	B	(I) (think) that might be referring to something (kind) (of) alternative to the draft Either you have military service or some sort of alternative nonmilitary service for a few years
sw4603.dff	16	A	of course military service falls under the category of a public service
sw4603.dff	18	A	(And) (so) one of the things that would fulfill at least the nominal qualifications set forth in the charge is military service or draft
sw4603.dff	20	A	but I agree with you that probably is not what was comprehended
sw4603.dff	20	A	There are other
sw4603.dff	21	B	i-
sw4603.dff	22	A	things such as civil service
sw4603.dff	24	A	which many people are lifelong employees of
sw4603.dff	26	A	but I suspect that was not what they had in mind either
sw4603.dff	26	A	More
sw4603.dff	28	A	of a voluntary kind of thing (or)
sw4603.dff	29	B	(i-) for years there has been an idea batted around of having some sort of alternative public service for young people to go into after high school
sw4603.dff	31	B	kind of in lieu of the draft for people who are conscientious objectors or don't otherwise want to be in the military okay you can go into the military or you can do this other thing for one or two years to kind of serve the community and learn about things
sw4603.dff	31	B	And it's interesting because I'm not a particular fan of the military but I have seen a lot of young guys go in that don't have really a clue as to what they want to do with their lives and aren't terribly disciplined even just personal discipline about what they want to do and they come out and now they have at least some marginally marketable skills and more discipline
sw4603.dff	31	B	(And) (you) (know) in some cases they have a greater self-esteem because they can see that if I do something or submit my own will to the will of the sargent (or) (whatever) at least for a short period of time I can accomplish a lot and it's a good lesson for a lot of young men to learn
sw4603.dff	31	B	That they don't need to be cowboys
sw4603.dff	31	B	They don't need to be out there (you) (know) constantly flaunting their ego to get things accomplished
sw4603.dff	33	B	And for some young men that's good
sw4603.dff	33	B	For me it would have been lousy idea (because)
sw4603.dff	34	A	Why
sw4603.dff	35	B	I did have the personal discipline
sw4603.dff	35	B	(And) (I) (went)
sw4603.dff	36	A	Why is that
sw4603.dff	37	B	to college for four years and got out But for some people that's good
sw4603.dff	37	B	I don't particular like the fact that it's the military and the whole point of the military is to kill people essentially
sw4603.dff	37	B	as an instrument of U S policy
sw4603.dff	38	A	no (no) (no)
sw4603.dff	38	A	It's to defend the nation against external evils
sw4603.dff	39	B	that's one view
sw4603.dff	39	B	(you) (know) and that's another debate
sw4603.dff	39	B	(But) (it's)
sw4603.dff	40	A	it depends on whether we figure that we have a defense oriented military or
sw4603.dff	42	A	an aggression oriented military
sw4603.dff	43	B	and it seems pretty aggressive oriented you look at the last military action which was in the Persian Gulf and wasn't anywhere near the United States (and) (you) (know) it was definitely a projection of U S power on the other side of the globe so at any rate this is getting off the topic but (i-) my point was that for people who don't want to do the military service it would be neat if there were an alternative that could instill the same sort of personal discipline and sense of purpose and sense of community that the Boy Scouts
sw4605.dff	58	A	I think so
sw4605.dff	58	A	(I) (think) (they) (all) (should) (test) really
sw4605.dff	60	A	it just seems like there is so much more of it going on anymore
sw4605.dff	62	A	that I don't know what's wrong with the people but I think that the government should do something about stopping it completely
sw4605.dff	62	A	About it coming into our country
sw4605.dff	62	A	they just slap somebody's little hand and don't do that again (and)
sw4605.dff	63	B	(I) (know) (They) (aren't)
sw4605.dff	64	A	(and) then (th-) they'll get out and they're back at it again
sw4605.dff	65	B	now it's too lucrative for the drug dealers so
sw4605.dff	67	B	the risks are worth it for them
sw4605.dff	70	A	But other than that why I don't know
sw4605.dff	70	A	Like I say maybe one of these days I'll get a job because I am looking still for a part-time job since my company went bankrupt and
sw4605.dff	72	A	I'll see what they do But like I say I wouldn't care because I don't even smoke so
sw4605.dff	74	A	they can test me all I want
sw4605.dff	74	A	I wonder if you take medicine if that would effect it
sw4605.dff	75	B	(tha-) it is a problem
sw4605.dff	75	B	Sometimes some medicines will give off a false positive
sw4605.dff	76	A	(now) (that)
sw4605.dff	77	B	I've heard of that
sw4605.dff	78	A	that would be really unfair then
sw4605.dff	80	A	(You) (know)
sw4605.dff	81	B	I believe you should have the testing but (they) (should) (be) if you get a positive they should double check you and still give you the benefit of a doubt
sw4605.dff	82	A	Find out (you) (know) if you have been taking some kind of medication and if that would effect it and everything
sw4605.dff	84	A	But I guess that's about all we can talk about
sw4605.dff	84	A	I think our five minutes is about up anyhow
sw4605.dff	85	B	it was nice talking to you Rose
sw4605.dff	86	A	(Okay) Lewis and maybe I'll talk to you again
sw4605.dff	87	B	(Okay)
sw4605.dff	88	A	Alrighty
sw4605.dff	89	B	Bye-bye
sw4605.dff	90	A	Bye-bye
sw4605.dff	90	A	Bye
sw4608.dff	17	A	(I) (mean) I can just sense I won't go to the grocery store at night
sw4608.dff	18	B	(that's)
sw4608.dff	19	A	(You) (know)
sw4608.dff	19	A	And it's that kind of thing and
sw4608.dff	20	B	That's really a shame when it has to constrain your activities (like)
sw4608.dff	21	A	We have a neighborhood watch program in the development that we live in which I think is a great way to reduce home theft burglary (and) (things)
sw4608.dff	22	B	(Sure)
sw4608.dff	23	A	(of) (that) (sort)
sw4608.dff	23	A	Do you have that where you live (or)
sw4608.dff	24	B	interestingly enough before I moved up here I'm an intern and then I go
sw4608.dff	26	B	back down in May
sw4608.dff	26	B	but in Orlando before I moved up we had a real problem with it
sw4608.dff	26	B	we've been broken into in my apartment about four times
sw4608.dff	27	A	(no)
sw4608.dff	28	B	in (like) two and a half weeks
sw4608.dff	28	B	And one of the things that I helped organize was a neighborhood watch type situation
sw4608.dff	30	B	down there
sw4608.dff	30	B	(because) (they) (were) (just) it's one of those things where the new thing is that they operate in the daylight because
sw4608.dff	32	B	everybody went to work and then the houses were left unguarded but I think given that people are pretty conscientious about it that's a good way to work it with a neighborhood
sw4608.dff	34	B	watch
sw4608.dff	35	A	also I've heard that the newest thing is a lot of people are specializing in robbing people during the time they're home
sw4608.dff	36	B	(is) (that)
sw4608.dff	37	A	Like on the weekends
sw4608.dff	37	A	A high percentage of free time I think it's like fifty percent of most people's free time is spent doing yard work
sw4608.dff	39	A	outdoors
sw4608.dff	39	A	So they wait while you're outdoors
sw4608.dff	39	A	They know the house is unlocked and then they just slip in
sw4608.dff	40	B	(That's) (amazing)
sw4608.dff	41	A	Slip in slip out They know exactly what they're going for
sw4608.dff	43	A	So I've heard that's really on the rise as far as
sw4608.dff	45	A	a new type of crime
sw4608.dff	46	B	it almost seems like they're getting quite a bit smarter
sw4608.dff	48	B	Really
sw4608.dff	49	A	Unfortunately yes
sw4608.dff	50	B	unfortunately it's starting to really look at people's habits and
sw4608.dff	52	B	where they are at particular points of the day
sw4608.dff	54	B	one of the guys I work with really laughs when he looks at Minneapolis because he's from Detroit
sw4608.dff	56	B	and the crime level there of course is quite a bit more pronounced
sw4608.dff	58	B	but (I) (guess)
sw4608.dff	60	B	(I) (think) we've got a neighborhood watch program here in Minneapolis (I'm) (not) (real) (sure)
sw4608.dff	61	A	it helps to know your neighbors (They) (give) (you) you're supposed to make lists of cars
sw4608.dff	61	A	I know a lot of my neighbors around my development
sw4608.dff	61	A	If I see a car that's unfamiliar we have a list is that what you did in your program
sw4608.dff	61	A	Where you have a list of license plates
sw4611.dff	1	A	(Hi)
sw4611.dff	2	B	(Hi)
sw4611.dff	3	A	I should say something
sw4611.dff	5	A	That I'm the least informed this is totally accidental that I have to talk about this topic
sw4611.dff	5	A	But I'm the least informed person in the whole United States
sw4611.dff	7	A	This has not been determined yet but I've never read a newspaper in my entire life and I never watch T V news nor listen to the news on the radio unless I'm just happening to be listening to music and they slip it on in the car radio before I can turn it off
sw4611.dff	7	A	(But)
sw4611.dff	8	B	Any particular reason
sw4611.dff	9	A	no
sw4611.dff	9	A	I've explored that with lots of people
sw4611.dff	9	A	they've tried to lock me up (and) (things) (like) (that)
sw4611.dff	9	A	But I'm basically not interested and I also find everything is so slick and superficial and misguided (and) (off) (the) (what) (am) (I) (trying) (to) (say)
sw4611.dff	11	A	I do learn about things
sw4611.dff	13	A	Largely from friends and I occasionally will read something like the NEW YORK REVIEW OF BOOKS
sw4611.dff	13	A	someone will write a book about something and then I'll learn all about this thing that was in the news two years earlier
sw4611.dff	15	A	(But) (it) (and) (somehow) and anything I participated in or know about when I read about it in the paper is always covered from such a funny and superficial perspective that I don't have much confidence in it
sw4611.dff	15	A	But I don't think it's just that I'm lazy
sw4611.dff	16	B	I really don't I like to refer to this as sort of CONSUMER REPORT phenomenon
sw4611.dff	18	B	Which is everybody that I know reads CONSUMER REPORTS so the people who do feel that CONSUMER REPORTS does a wholly inadequate job in their area of particular interest
sw4611.dff	20	B	But assume that they do a reasonable job in other areas
sw4611.dff	22	B	without thinking that there were people who think each other area of specialty (and) (I) (guess) you could explain it two ways
sw4611.dff	22	B	and the cynical view is these things aren't doing a very good job at all
sw4611.dff	22	B	And the view that I would rather take
sw4611.dff	24	B	is that there's a different amount of information you need when you're particularly interested in a topic or particularly interested in buying something as a
sw4611.dff	26	B	(as) (a) hobbyist versus when you want to go out and buy a blender because you need to mix things
sw4611.dff	28	B	And I think the same thing is true with news
sw4611.dff	28	B	If you want to just have an idea as to what's going on most papers and especially the better papers the TIMES the WALL STREET JOURNAL the
sw4611.dff	30	B	WASHINGTON POST give you a reasonable idea
sw4611.dff	32	B	If you were deeply involved in it then you immediately realize that what they print is stuff that you probably knew already and the stuff that you want they're not printing because the average person doesn't need or want to know
sw4611.dff	33	A	(Doesn't) (want)
sw4611.dff	34	B	that much
sw4611.dff	35	A	Let me ask by the way just for the record
sw4611.dff	35	A	I totally concede that intelligent people read these things and intelligent people write them
sw4611.dff	35	A	I'm not being elitist in that sense I hope
sw4611.dff	36	B	there's a reasonable question as to whether it's worth the amount of time it takes to keep up on things
sw4611.dff	37	A	(What)
sw4611.dff	38	B	And most people think it is and I can accept that some people think it's not and can find better ways to use it
sw4611.dff	39	A	By the way when you say most people think it is I think it's like ninety-nine point ninety-nine (think) (it) (is) percent
sw4611.dff	40	B	I don't think it's that high
sw4611.dff	41	A	you don't
sw4611.dff	42	B	I know a lot of people who may watch the T V news in the evening but don't spend the time to actually read a newspaper
sw4611.dff	44	B	And I think they're saying if something's really important I'll at least find out that it happened
sw4611.dff	46	B	and that's (is) a reasonable start and for awhile I didn't read a newspaper when I came out here because I didn't find one that I liked
sw4611.dff	46	B	and if something important happened it was covered on T V and I could then go and pick up newspapers if it were important enough to read about
sw4611.dff	48	B	And I imagine you get the same level of something that you cared about happened you'd find out from friends or other channels
sw4611.dff	49	A	I did on the Supreme Court hearings (for) (the) (whole) (business) (of) (I) (actually) (have) (a)
sw4615.dff	1	A	why don't you go ahead first
sw4615.dff	2	B	(Okay)
sw4615.dff	2	B	short term it works out pretty well because we have just enough to cover expenses with a little left over so budgeting (in) (the) (short) (term) isn't too much of an issue because there's not that much
sw4615.dff	3	A	(Sure)
sw4615.dff	4	B	extra to go around
sw4615.dff	4	B	long term is something we're starting to think about because our older child will be ready for college in (gee) she's eight now so I guess about ten years
sw4615.dff	6	B	(Good) (heavens)
sw4615.dff	6	B	So we're starting to think about long term considerations
sw4615.dff	6	B	College and retirement
sw4615.dff	6	B	But with not a whole lot of discretionary money it's kind of hard to figure out how to do it
sw4615.dff	7	A	(Sure)
sw4615.dff	8	B	How about you
sw4615.dff	9	A	(That's) (kind) (of) (to) what we're doing is budgeting Month to month is (kind) (of) taking into consideration what the bills are and what's extra so that's (kind) (of) how we do it (from) (month) (to) (month) depending on what insurance is due or whatever
sw4615.dff	11	A	long term that's a little bit easier for us because with our jobs we can take out extra money towards savings Four One K plans
sw4615.dff	13	A	(you) (know) retirement plans that kind of stuff so we can (kind) (of) put aside some money that actually is better for us not to see
sw4615.dff	15	A	versus when it's on the paycheck and you have to try and take out some of that money
sw4615.dff	15	A	You always find something a little extra that you'd like to get that month so long term probably is a little bit better than short term simply because it's automatically taken out
sw4615.dff	15	A	So that works out much better for us (so) that's kind of how we do it anyway (but)
sw4615.dff	16	B	And the old if you can't see it then you can't spend it idea
sw4615.dff	17	A	(exactly) and if you can't touch it you can't spend it either
sw4615.dff	17	A	So that (kind) (of) works out where you get into some plans that (you) (know) you touch it you're going to get a penalty (that) (kind) (of) (thing) so it leads you to (kind) (of) say well I'm not going to take it out
sw4615.dff	17	A	I'm going to (keep) (it) (and) keep it in there and let it grow so that someway maybe for retirement you're going to have that money
sw4615.dff	19	A	(left)
sw4615.dff	19	A	Let's hope anyway so
sw4615.dff	21	A	you'll have that so that's (kind) (of) how we do it
sw4615.dff	21	A	But ours is more like month to month too short term is to get things going (so)
sw4615.dff	21	A	(other) (than) (that) (is) (kind) (of) (how) (we) (do) (it) (so)
sw4615.dff	21	A	I don't
sw4615.dff	23	A	know if our time is up or what
sw4615.dff	24	B	(they'll)
sw4615.dff	25	A	They'll let us know
sw4615.dff	26	B	(exactly)
sw4615.dff	26	B	we actually do have some money in a Four One K
sw4615.dff	26	B	I just
sw4615.dff	28	B	wish I could afford to put more away each week (because) (I) (agree) (that) (it's) (an) (excellent) (way)
sw4615.dff	29	A	(definitely) (definitely)
sw4615.dff	29	A	(And) it grows it seems like at first you're not going to see a big return but as the years go on if you're with the company for any length of time then it gets much better (and)
sw4615.dff	31	A	so you just have to kind of look at it that way and there's other savings plans or other things that you can do
sw4615.dff	31	A	Automatic deposit from checks to where you don't see it
sw4615.dff	33	A	(And) exactly whatever is in our checking account is basically just about what gets spent
sw4615.dff	35	A	It's put into our savings account and we don't see it then it works out to where you don't look at it you just look at the checking account
sw4615.dff	37	A	and say this is what we have for money and that's it (so) ()
sw4615.dff	38	B	checking account's a very dangerous place for money to be (I'm) (convinced)
sw4615.dff	39	A	it's easy because you do spend it that's for sure
sw4615.dff	39	A	(Like) (I) (said) you kind of look at it you better have some other way of savings checking accounts aren't the best for long term type of planning And you don't get a good return on it anyway (so) (other)
sw4615.dff	40	B	(I) (guess) other than things like the stock market or mutual funds there's really not much of a return on anything these days
sw4615.dff	41	A	(Exactly)
sw4615.dff	41	A	now
sw4615.dff	41	A	it's a bad time
sw4615.dff	42	B	the interest is so low
sw4615.dff	42	B	it's nice for people buying homes but
sw4615.dff	44	B	for older people who have money
sw4615.dff	46	B	in C D -s (or) (whatever) it must be awfully hard to see rates go down to three and a half percent or whatever
sw4615.dff	47	A	(Exactly) (exactly)
sw4615.dff	47	A	we have some in-laws that had theirs in some money market certificates and other things and (kind) (of) took them out of that because they got so low but it drops so your better bet is to try to get in with something with your corporation if they have some kind of savings plans (or) (something) (like) (that) (to) where they kind of match the percentage or whatever or some kind of profit sharing (so)
sw4618.dff	18	B	do you know how wrong they are
sw4618.dff	18	B	(I) (mean) is there a margin of error
sw4618.dff	19	A	The accuracy
sw4618.dff	19	A	I don't know
sw4618.dff	19	A	(I) (don't) (know)
sw4618.dff	19	A	But I know there are a lot of things that can influence them and I think that a person deserves a second chance with it (or) (something) because most things will stay in your system for a long time
sw4618.dff	21	A	And if you could show that I interviewed for a job recently and I was taking Entex
sw4618.dff	23	A	And my doctor gave me a prescription for it
sw4618.dff	23	A	And he said this way if it were to make the drug test positive you have proof that your doctor ordered this for you And it didn't come up that I needed to do it but this could happen to anybody and if they would just say this person's drug test is positive we won't hire them
sw4618.dff	25	A	Then you could lose out on a job when really you didn't do anything
sw4618.dff	27	A	(So) (I) (don't) (know)
sw4618.dff	28	B	And I'm not so sure they are that needed
sw4618.dff	29	A	I'm not
sw4618.dff	31	A	sure either
sw4618.dff	31	A	The only way I can see it is that if they really suspect a person of using it then they have the to go ahead and prove it because they say they can spot check
sw4618.dff	32	B	(Ye-) if you're using it while at a job I can see a problem
sw4618.dff	34	B	But the occasional person then like it's almost an infringement of your privacy
sw4618.dff	35	A	it sort of is
sw4618.dff	35	A	And this is it (this) I'm not real sure how I feel about it because I can see it from two ways
sw4618.dff	35	A	as a health professional I wouldn't want somebody to take care of me that was using drugs
sw4618.dff	37	A	so as a patient I feel we probably should be protected
sw4618.dff	37	A	But on the other hand there's a lot of things I should be protected from that they don't test my patients for too
sw4618.dff	37	A	(So)
sw4619.dff	1	B	(Bye)
sw4619.dff	1	B	our discussion's about the care of the elderly
sw4619.dff	2	A	(That's) that's what do you think is important
sw4619.dff	2	A	(If) (you) (were) I don't know how old you are but if you had parents (say) or grandparents (whatever) (it) (is) (who) (were) (ready)
sw4619.dff	4	A	who you thought might benefit from a nursing home what do you think you would look for
sw4619.dff	5	B	my dad's almost ninety and
sw4619.dff	7	B	he lives by himself (and) he's in good shape
sw4619.dff	9	B	but some friends of mine have gone through this
sw4619.dff	9	B	I think I'd look for a home where they got a lot of attention and where they did some things to try to keep them mentally alive
sw4619.dff	11	B	(And) where there were caring and compassionate people operating it
sw4619.dff	11	B	Do
sw4619.dff	13	B	you have any experience with this yourself
sw4619.dff	14	A	my wife's grandmother
sw4619.dff	16	A	is in a nursing home in Minnesota and we go there once a year
sw4619.dff	16	A	we tend to see her there cause we're in Boston so we're pretty far away
sw4619.dff	16	A	When we visit Minnesota though we go to see her
sw4619.dff	18	A	(And) (it) (seems) the environment there (I) (don't) (know) (too) (much) (about) (it) (but) it seems nice enough
sw4619.dff	18	A	it's hard at least half of the residents (I) (would) (say) are not mentally sound
sw4619.dff	18	A	So it's hard to tell how much of that rubs off on those who are struggling to retain clarity
sw4619.dff	19	B	From the lack of stimulation you mean
sw4619.dff	20	A	I don't know
sw4619.dff	20	A	(we) (also) my wife and I volunteer to go to a nursing home that's just a mile from our house
sw4619.dff	20	A	she goes more often than I
sw4619.dff	20	A	We used to go once every two months to visit some of the patients there
sw4619.dff	20	A	(And) we have a two year old son and (so) sometimes we'd take him with us
sw4619.dff	20	A	(And) there I would say it's the same thing
sw4619.dff	20	A	it's a relatively nice environment but (again) it must be depressing for the people who are just essentially not able to take care of themselves in their own house but (certainly) have retained all of their mental skills (and) (so) (on)
sw4619.dff	20	A	(It's) must be depressing to walk the halls and see all these other people who really don't know where they are
sw4619.dff	21	B	Do you think that in the case of the one that you've actually had some experience with that the people who operate it seem to have what you'd perceive of as genuine concern
sw4619.dff	22	A	(I) (think) (I) (think) they're relatively respectful
sw4619.dff	22	A	and concerned in as much as they can be
sw4619.dff	22	A	(you) (know) I've noticed some of the patients asking for things just repetitively
sw4619.dff	24	A	but things that are not reasonable and so
sw4619.dff	26	A	(at) (some) (level) (the) I'm sure that the staff learn what's normal for this person and so it looks to me like maybe their not catering to this person's needs is really because this person (you) (know) is just in a state where they don't really need what they think they need
sw4619.dff	27	B	(it's) (possible) (I) (was) (thinking) also that there could be a fair burn out factor
sw4619.dff	29	B	in just having to respond to people's needs where the needs are sometimes depending on the person not going to be what we would perceive of as rational need
sw4619.dff	30	A	I'll tell you one thing though that I saw that was really nice
sw4619.dff	30	A	(We) (saw) a husband and wife (we) (used) (to) (see) (a) (husband) (and) (wife) in there together and they were in the same room which not all husband and wives were but these two were
sw4619.dff	32	A	And when you walked into their room they had brought all their furniture from their house
sw4619.dff	33	B	So it
sw4619.dff	34	A	(And) (so)
sw4619.dff	35	B	gives them a sense of identity
sw4619.dff	36	A	you walked in there and it didn't look like how you walk into some rooms and it's completely generic
sw4619.dff	36	A	There's nothing maybe a picture or two that belongs to that person and that's it
sw4619.dff	36	A	But this room on the other hand they got rid of all of the sort of standard issue beds and dressers and this and that and they had all their stuff from their house and (it) (looked) (like) (it) (must) (have) (been) it was nicer to walk in there and to talk to them and it must also give them a sense of security (and) (s-)
sw4619.dff	37	B	I think part of what you're saying matches what I have read
sw4619.dff	37	B	I used to initially think that the only people who went into such residences were people who were adequately deficient in their abilities
sw4619.dff	39	B	physical or mental that they couldn't take care of themselves
sw4619.dff	39	B	But I also know a couple of people whose parents have gone into such things because I think they provide a lot of social activities
sw4619.dff	41	B	one of my friend's parents who went in because she had largely lost her abilities and she was in there for awhile when they were away on vacation
sw4619.dff	41	B	(and)
sw4619.dff	42	A	temporary
sw4619.dff	42	A	(I) that's new to me
sw4619.dff	42	A	(I)
sw4619.dff	43	B	I think it was sort of on the grounds that they were considering whether she would live there and I feel like the whole vocabulary of this is very loaded if you think of words like put her in there
sw4626.dff	1	A	(Okay)
sw4626.dff	2	B	How are you
sw4626.dff	2	B	You want to go ahead and start talking about whether you budget
sw4626.dff	3	A	(Yes)
sw4626.dff	3	A	I feel like I am from Mars
sw4626.dff	3	A	I'm fifty years old and I've been divorced for eighteen years
sw4626.dff	3	A	But I've two kids and all
sw4626.dff	3	A	But I've never had a budget and I don't do any planning and I don't know
sw4626.dff	5	A	I don't have a long-term financial plan
sw4626.dff	5	A	I don't try to control my expenses
sw4626.dff	7	A	But I'm glad you're a stranger
sw4626.dff	8	B	That sounds kind of like me
sw4626.dff	9	A	But really well I'm curious how other people live
sw4626.dff	9	A	so maybe we should start with you
sw4626.dff	9	A	What do you do
sw4626.dff	10	B	About the same thing
sw4626.dff	11	A	Really
sw4626.dff	13	A	Maybe they're going to arrest us both
sw4626.dff	14	B	I'm even in worse shape because I have eight children and we live from hand to mouth
sw4626.dff	14	B	We hope that there's enough money at the end of the month to pay for the bills and if there's not then we due for the next month
sw4626.dff	15	A	(Wow)
sw4626.dff	16	B	A couple of times we've tried some things and they worked but I'm not disciplined enough to keep doing it
sw4626.dff	18	B	The best program we ever had is at the beginning of the month we took my check and divided it out into envelopes
sw4626.dff	20	B	and then paid for the expenses out of that envelope and when the envelope was empty then you didn't have any more money to spend in that area
sw4626.dff	22	B	And that worked out real well cause we didn't have to keep writing down what we'd spent
sw4626.dff	24	B	It was just that when that was empty you knew you were out of money
sw4626.dff	24	B	And we did that pretty successfully for about three months and then we started borrowing from one envelope to put it in the other envelope and in about two months we were back to doing the same thing we always do
sw4626.dff	25	A	(The) I had a part-time job around gosh fifteen years ago seventy-six
sw4626.dff	27	A	(and) this was a sort of a career shift at the time and so I was willing to take a half time job to do that
sw4626.dff	27	A	(And) (I) (actually) (did) (my) (bank) (account) (would) I kept bouncing checks just at the end of the month but I had miscalculated
sw4626.dff	27	A	well I didn't keep a balance
sw4626.dff	27	A	It's one of the problems
sw4626.dff	29	A	I never had to in the past
sw4626.dff	31	A	I always kept plenty of money in my checking account but when you're only earning half the salary
sw4626.dff	31	A	Even though I wasn't spending much money (I) (sometimes) (would) (just) things would get to tight
sw4626.dff	31	A	and sometimes what I would do is keep a piece of paper in my wallet and every time I spent money cash mostly I would write it down
sw4626.dff	33	A	so I could see at the end of a month how much I spent on food so I could do better planning
sw4626.dff	35	A	But I would forget to write the things down and I don't know if I ever went as far as three months or not in keeping that kind of data
sw4626.dff	35	A	I certainly haven't done that in sixteen years (or) (whatever)
sw4626.dff	36	B	I even find now with the automatic tellers I'll go take money out of that
sw4626.dff	38	B	and then I forget to take that out of my checking account
sw4626.dff	40	B	And
sw4626.dff	42	B	So I leave a little bit of a slush fund in my checking account so the balance showing in the checking account is always somewhat different that what's really there
sw4626.dff	44	B	And I figure that gives me room for the mistakes I make
sw4626.dff	45	A	(The) (I) (have) (to) (say) (that) (let's) (see) at this point on I don't run out of money
sw4626.dff	45	A	(and) (it) (and) (I) (don't) someday if I were to get remarried I might want to buy a house which requires lots of money which I don't have and I think my strategy (if) (I) (may) is to not spend money
sw4626.dff	45	A	I don't have expensive tastes
sw4626.dff	45	A	I don't go out
sw4626.dff	45	A	I buy a car the last car I got rid of I'd had it was nineteen years old
sw4626.dff	47	A	people were embarrassed for me
sw4626.dff	47	A	it was a good car (and)
sw4626.dff	48	B	But it was still running
sw4626.dff	49	A	it was great
sw4626.dff	49	A	my mechanics loved it because it was a sixty-five Buick and it just wouldn't stop
sw4626.dff	49	A	(and) (it) I just didn't feel the need for a new car
sw4626.dff	49	A	It isn't like I couldn't afford one
sw4626.dff	51	A	and now (I) (don't) I tend to eat expensive food
sw4626.dff	51	A	I don't mind buying a good steak but for me I only do that every week or
sw4626.dff	53	A	maybe once a month
sw4626.dff	55	A	you buy a tenderloin steak it costs outrageous twelve dollars a pound
sw4626.dff	55	A	(You) (buy) (a) less than half a pound so it's six or seven dollars
sw4626.dff	55	A	To me I realize if you have eight kids you're not going to run out and do that
sw4626.dff	56	B	Not very often
sw4626.dff	57	A	but I'm just saying as a single person that's a drop in the bucket
sw4626.dff	57	A	And so if you're extravagant on how you buy food it doesn't add up
sw4626.dff	57	A	I (mean) if you're not going to super expensive restaurants which I don't care to go to
sw4626.dff	58	B	(That's)
sw4626.dff	59	A	(so) (that's) (I) (think) one of the reasons I don't need to budget is that I don't have to hold myself back from buying that expensive thing because I can't afford it because I'm not interested in that expensive thing
sw4626.dff	60	B	(A) (lot) (of)
sw4628.dff	30	B	And I was reading this book (one) (time) (about) (this) (guy) (that) (had) I think the company still exists
sw4628.dff	30	B	What they use to do is (they) (used) (to) cut the number of hours for everybody as opposed to just laying people off
sw4628.dff	32	B	That way that one person wouldn't get one big blunt blow at one time
sw4628.dff	34	B	And I think if they had programs that set up to subsidize people that do get laid off a little bit better other than (you) (know) something like unemployment is good but the company as a whole because you as an employee even the company is making money they paying you a salary but you are responsible for that company growth
sw4628.dff	34	B	You're responsible also for helping that company get to the point that it's at (at) making profits
sw4628.dff	34	B	So there should be something in there (or) some kind of clause that will subsidize people if they did lose their job other than neglect or something like that
sw4628.dff	36	B	Because it's not a person's fault that people not buying or businesses are not on the up and up all the time I don't see how one or two people (maybe) (more) (one) (or) (two) (but) a number of people can be the downfall of a company situation
sw4628.dff	37	A	how do you mean that
sw4628.dff	37	A	(I) (know) (it)
sw4628.dff	38	B	(in) (a) (sense) (that) (say) how do you make a conclusion that you're going to lay off these ten people
sw4628.dff	40	B	for the bad times of the company
sw4628.dff	40	B	What about the work effort those ten people did when the company was doing well
sw4628.dff	42	B	In that standpoint
sw4628.dff	43	A	you think it's better than to try to spread the effort equally among all the employees of the company (or)
sw4628.dff	44	B	(yes) I do
sw4628.dff	46	B	(I) (really) (do)
sw4628.dff	46	B	I think it'd be better that way and even at that it would at least give the person time to look for another job (because)
sw4628.dff	48	B	they know that there are problems and there are reason to look for another job
sw4628.dff	50	B	instead of just dumping it on them all at one time
sw4628.dff	52	B	that's my views
sw4628.dff	53	A	I've heard of a couple of companies that have done that
sw4628.dff	53	A	(I) (think) back about a few years ago when things were tough Hewlett-Packard did that for awhile
sw4628.dff	53	A	They went to a four and a half day work week rather
sw4628.dff	55	A	than just cut everybody back ten percent
sw4628.dff	57	A	And have to give everybody a half day a week off
sw4628.dff	59	A	And I think you can do that for a little while (but) (I'm)
sw4628.dff	60	B	at least that would give a person a chance to look
sw4628.dff	62	B	Because the way it is a person really don't have a chance
sw4630.dff	4	B	I'm kind of the opposite of you
sw4630.dff	4	B	I get all my news from newspapers
sw4630.dff	5	A	you do
sw4630.dff	6	B	we have two newspapers
sw4630.dff	7	A	You read it in the morning then
sw4630.dff	8	B	Two newspapers in the morning
sw4630.dff	10	B	(And)
sw4630.dff	11	A	(Sure)
sw4630.dff	12	B	I'm in a government position that I'm in the news a lot so I kind of look through to see what I'm quoted in
sw4630.dff	13	A	(sure)
sw4630.dff	14	B	how bad the quotes are every day
sw4630.dff	15	A	To see if they did it or if they criticize you or
sw4630.dff	17	A	put something in there wrong
sw4630.dff	17	A	(Sure) (sure)
sw4630.dff	18	B	Or sometimes there's letter to the editor about me or there's (a) even editorials
sw4630.dff	19	A	(Sure)
sw4630.dff	20	B	for and against what I'm doing
sw4630.dff	21	A	(Sure) (exactly)
sw4630.dff	22	B	but the T V I don't really watch even if I'm on it
sw4630.dff	23	A	(sure)
sw4630.dff	24	B	(But) (just)
sw4630.dff	25	A	that's kind of like you said then
sw4630.dff	25	A	we are kind of on the opposite where I get home and while I'm cooking supper the T V is on and watching the news or trying to catch up with what is going on and very seldom do I catch the ten o'clock so by that time old news is probably what I hear through the grapevine or whatever
sw4630.dff	25	A	But unless there is a big issue going on like when we were at war then I think everybody was glued to the T V to find out what was going on
sw4630.dff	27	A	But other than that no
sw4630.dff	27	A	(It's)
sw4630.dff	28	B	And that's (C) (N) (N) (had) (the) everybody was watching C N N that seemed to be the place to be
sw4630.dff	29	A	(Exactly) (exactly) (exactly) (sure)
sw4630.dff	30	B	to find out what was going on on (that)
sw4630.dff	32	B	At that point I was watching the T V
sw4630.dff	34	B	On something like that
sw4630.dff	35	A	it brought kind of more of a vivid look at what was going on when they were dropping the bombs and just a lot of different things
sw4630.dff	35	A	But that's true
sw4630.dff	35	A	you know a lot of people that read the newspapers to get the news of what's going on and other people that do it differently or don't even watch any news at all (But)
sw4630.dff	36	B	the thing is with T V (I) a lot of times the news on the local T V is so brief you really don't get the full picture of what's going on
sw4630.dff	37	A	(Exactly) (happens)
sw4630.dff	37	A	(Sure) (sure)
sw4630.dff	37	A	(That's)
sw4630.dff	38	B	And (that's) a problem that I have is getting just a (little) brief idea of what's happening
sw4630.dff	38	B	(But)
sw4630.dff	39	A	(sure) a clip a sentence or two and that's about it of what went on and they have so much other information to cover in such a short period of time
sw4630.dff	39	A	(Sure)
sw4630.dff	40	B	(But)
sw4630.dff	41	A	(Makes) (sense)
sw4630.dff	42	B	I like the weather report
sw4630.dff	44	B	(So) (I) (wa-) I always turn that on
sw4630.dff	46	B	(that's) (one) (part) (I) (watch) because I go surfing down here and I always
sw4630.dff	48	B	want to watch the weather for when the waves are going to be good
sw4630.dff	49	A	So you're on the coast line
sw4630.dff	49	A	You're not further up
sw4630.dff	49	A	(You're)
sw4630.dff	50	B	No
sw4630.dff	50	B	on the south Florida coast
sw4630.dff	51	A	(Sure)
sw4630.dff	52	B	Where the weather is still warm here
sw4630.dff	53	A	(Sure)
sw4630.dff	53	A	(I) (suppose) you watch for hurricanes coming in and
sw4630.dff	55	A	things like that
sw4630.dff	55	A	(Sure)
sw4630.dff	56	B	Weather channel's good
sw4630.dff	57	A	that's about the only time in the summer if you're watching T V for the weather even though it's very hard to predict what's going on they'll kind of say there's a thunderstorm warning (or) (whatever)
sw4630.dff	57	A	This is what is expected but a lot of times things (happen) (and) change here so (drastically) (so) fast
sw4630.dff	59	A	where movement that was coming in has shifted (or) (whatever) (so)
sw4630.dff	60	B	I mostly look for the storms (out) in the ocean
sw4630.dff	62	B	hundreds of miles out so I can predict my week and
sw4630.dff	64	B	where I'm going to be
sw4630.dff	65	A	(Sure)
sw4630.dff	66	B	So I can be at the beach when the waves start coming in
sw4630.dff	67	A	(to) (take) (off)
sw4630.dff	67	A	(Sure)
sw4630.dff	67	A	(That) (sounds) (pretty) (good) (so)
sw4630.dff	67	A	I don't know if our time is getting up here or it's got to be fairly close (to) (that)
sw4633.dff	30	A	(we) (really) (did) (not)
sw4633.dff	30	A	My next oldest daughter that's in college in California is a world twirling champion
sw4633.dff	30	A	She twirls a baton (and) (we) (did) (a) (lot) (of) (things) (together)
sw4633.dff	32	A	She and I did a lot of things together and (flew) we have flown all over the world for her to compete and to perform
sw4633.dff	34	A	And that was a lot of fun
sw4633.dff	34	A	But I guess you could consider that organized
sw4633.dff	34	A	there is a competition all the time
sw4633.dff	36	A	We were very heavy into that
sw4633.dff	36	A	Other than that (they) (were) (pretty) (much) (and) maybe dancing school for a while or mainly school sports (and) (things) (like) (that)
sw4633.dff	37	B	I think that's probably true
sw4633.dff	37	B	(The) if you have one child or fewer you get involved in organized events or
sw4633.dff	39	B	activities and if you have a large number of children then you don't
sw4633.dff	40	A	you can't afford to
sw4633.dff	41	B	(No) (you) (ca-) and there's not enough time
sw4633.dff	43	B	my son is in Little League this year
sw4633.dff	43	B	He's ten
sw4633.dff	43	B	And they practice three times a week and they have a game and (it's) (just) if there were more than one child (I) (don't) (know) there would be no way to do it
sw4633.dff	44	A	(That's)
sw4633.dff	45	B	one parent go one direction and I'd have to go in the other and
sw4633.dff	47	B	we could only cover two at that
sw4633.dff	48	A	(I) (know) I spent hours in the gym every day with my daughter and my little one also competed because really she had no choice
sw4633.dff	48	A	She had to go with me
sw4633.dff	50	A	So the three of us just spent a lot of time traveling and competing and (of) (course) the competing itself really didn't matter what it was it was making the friends and going all the places and it was a really neat experience but it took our total time
sw4633.dff	50	A	I did not work when I did this
sw4633.dff	50	A	Now I do work full-time
sw4633.dff	52	A	And it's just
sw4633.dff	54	A	my thirteen year old and myself and so we really have to keep it together to get just her activities in and still have time to spend with each other
sw4633.dff	54	A	(So)
sw4633.dff	55	B	(I) (don't) (think) (although) (i-) (I) (think) more than one child probably three children is probably the ideal to me but I'm not sure I could afford three
sw4633.dff	55	B	I most certainly couldn't educate three
sw4633.dff	57	B	I don't know how my parents did it
sw4633.dff	59	B	there were five of us and I don't recall wanting anything in particular
sw4633.dff	59	B	but I don't know how my father did it
sw4633.dff	59	B	He worked at a truck line and he just didn't make that kind of money with five children
sw4633.dff	59	B	But we did okay
sw4633.dff	59	B	We had a house and a home and but now my wife and I both work and I don't believe we have as much as my parents did and we only have one child
sw4633.dff	60	A	(Really)
sw4633.dff	62	A	things cost a lot more
sw4633.dff	62	A	I don't know how it is in Georgia
sw4633.dff	64	A	and I don't think our part of the country is particularly bad compared to some
sw4633.dff	65	B	Atlanta is horrible
sw4633.dff	66	A	Is it
sw4633.dff	67	B	Yes
sw4633.dff	67	B	we have a lot of people moving here from Boston and different areas and from talking to them they're shocked
sw4633.dff	68	A	(Really)
sw4633.dff	69	B	(Wha-) (and) (they) the housing is so cheap
sw4633.dff	71	B	in comparison to Boston
sw4633.dff	72	A	That's what I've heard
sw4633.dff	73	B	that they jump on it
sw4633.dff	73	B	They sell their house they stash away a good bit of money and come down here and I work with a lot of them they think they have really done something
sw4633.dff	73	B	Then when they get down here they realize the cost of living is outrageous
sw4633.dff	75	B	compared to where they came from
sw4633.dff	77	B	The housing is cheaper but that's about it
sw4642.dff	1	A	I try to stay away from cars as much as possible in terms of
sw4642.dff	3	A	repair
sw4642.dff	3	A	that is really a sore spot with me
sw4642.dff	3	A	I think perhaps the automotive industry is improving but ten years ago reliability of automobiles at least U S automobiles was pretty dismal and not only that but the repair capability of service departments and dealerships was equally dismal
sw4642.dff	5	A	and it seemed that the only way I could reliably take care of my car was to repair it myself which is not my cup of tea
sw4642.dff	7	A	(But) (I)
sw4642.dff	8	B	So do you have a car
sw4642.dff	9	A	(Pardon)
sw4642.dff	10	B	(Do) (you) (have) (a) (car)
sw4642.dff	11	A	at that time I had a Volkswagen Rabbit
sw4642.dff	13	A	and it was a real lemon
sw4642.dff	13	A	subsequently I got a Buick Century and it wasn't as bad
sw4642.dff	15	A	But last year I bought a Honda Accord and I take it in once every seventy-five hundred miles for its periodic maintenance and that is it
sw4642.dff	15	A	And it's wonderful
sw4642.dff	16	B	We used to have a Honda Accord and (they're) (good)
sw4642.dff	16	B	(They're) (really) (good) (cars)
sw4642.dff	16	B	Every time I get taken to an auto repair place (every) (time) (I) (go) (I) (get) (taken)
sw4642.dff	16	B	Bad
sw4642.dff	18	B	Woman goes in and they go all we got a sucker
sw4642.dff	18	B	Let's see how much money we can get out of her
sw4642.dff	20	B	(That's) (what) (happens) (every) (time)
sw4642.dff	22	B	(so)
sw4642.dff	23	A	what do you have
sw4642.dff	24	B	I have a Pontiac Six Thousand
sw4642.dff	25	A	All the more reason to have a Honda
sw4642.dff	26	B	But our Honda just got old and just wore out
sw4642.dff	26	B	It was (let's) (see) eleven years old and it just out of it (so)
sw4642.dff	27	A	so you bought a Pontiac
sw4642.dff	28	B	No My (ex-husband's) this just happened a couple of weeks ago
sw4642.dff	28	B	He's my ex-husband but just a few months ago when he was my husband his father gave us this car and everything is wrong with it
sw4642.dff	28	B	the power steering fluid leaks the oil leaks the brake fluid leaks
sw4642.dff	29	A	(Now) (thi-) how old is the car
sw4642.dff	30	B	eighty-seven
sw4642.dff	32	B	And he just doesn't take care of things but I was awarded the car (so)
sw4642.dff	32	B	There is a man in my church that is a mechanic and I can trust him
sw4642.dff	32	B	So he is trying to get things fixed on it
sw4642.dff	34	B	But it's just leak leak leak everywhere
sw4642.dff	34	B	But I hate to go into a repair place because they'll tell me something is wrong with it and it's not and charge me twice as much
sw4642.dff	34	B	The last time I took it into a repair shop the man told me I needed a master cylinder
sw4642.dff	34	B	So I said okay
sw4642.dff	34	B	And he charged me a hundred and thirty something dollars and then about a month later a man was looking at my car and he asked me not a repair man but just a friend and I was telling him that I just a new master cylinder put on and he looked at and he said that's not a new master cylinder
sw4642.dff	36	B	and I didn't even know what one was
sw4642.dff	36	B	And he showed it to me and it was old rusty just awful
sw4642.dff	36	B	It was no more new than nothing
sw4642.dff	37	A	So apparently it was the same one that was on there
sw4642.dff	38	B	(more) (than) (likely)
sw4642.dff	39	A	probably filled the brake fluid up and that was it
sw4642.dff	40	B	That was it probably
sw4642.dff	40	B	(It) (was) (ve-) I was so irritated
sw4642.dff	40	B	And that's happened to me more than once or twice
sw4642.dff	40	B	just about every time I've went in somewhere
sw4642.dff	41	A	So what's the solution to that
sw4642.dff	41	A	I guess find a reputable service
sw4642.dff	42	B	and you can hardly find one
sw4642.dff	44	B	The guy that's doing most of my car now goes to my church and that's the only reason I go to him
sw4642.dff	46	B	because I know him and I know he will tell me the truth
sw4642.dff	46	B	Because he doesn't even charge me for doing it so he's not going to take me
sw4644.dff	1	A	preferred benefits I worked for a large corporation in the past and I think large corporations can give better benefits than small corporations because now I'm working for a very small corporation where the owner is there and there is a lot of profit that's coming in but when it comes to small corporations they seem to pocket it a little bit quickly (or) (whatever) or however you want to say it and the benefits aren't as great when I worked for a big corporation because the big corporations seem to look at its employees and say okay we've got this amount of money let's put into this plan this plan you got Four One K plans
sw4644.dff	1	A	You have better vacation plans you have just in general maternity leave plans
sw4644.dff	3	A	that kind of thing
sw4644.dff	3	A	Big corporations are able to do that versus small corporations they just don't have the money or just feel that there isn't the need for it
sw4644.dff	3	A	So I've worked for both big and small so I've had a chance to (kind) (of) take a look at the pros and cons of both
sw4644.dff	4	B	well I worked for H and R Block here in Massachusetts
sw4644.dff	5	A	(Sure)
sw4644.dff	6	B	for awhile
sw4644.dff	8	B	And the only they even hate to give out unemployment
sw4644.dff	9	A	(Sure)
sw4644.dff	10	B	at the end of tax season because
sw4644.dff	12	B	fairly even though they're a large scale company (they're) (very)
sw4644.dff	13	A	(Sure)
sw4644.dff	14	B	(the) (offices) the individual offices are very small
sw4644.dff	16	B	and now I work for the Framingham school system because I'm a teacher
sw4644.dff	17	A	(Sure)
sw4644.dff	18	B	And we have much better benefits in the system
sw4644.dff	20	B	We have a good pension plan
sw4644.dff	20	B	(let) (me) (see) we have a profit sharing plan to a degree
sw4644.dff	21	A	(That's) (pretty) good for being a school district type program
sw4644.dff	22	B	And we have the eye glasses the health care
sw4644.dff	24	B	and the whole kit and caboodle (because) (what)
sw4644.dff	25	A	(Wow)
sw4644.dff	26	B	they did is they threw all the town employees in together
sw4644.dff	27	A	That's extremely good
sw4644.dff	29	A	the small corporation that I work for
sw4644.dff	29	A	There's no pension plan
sw4644.dff	30	B	(Really)
sw4644.dff	31	A	there's no type of savings of any sort that the company will reimburse you for
sw4644.dff	31	A	(There's) (really) I think you're allowed I think two or three days a year
sw4644.dff	31	A	It's not accumulative type of sick leave
sw4644.dff	33	A	things like that
sw4644.dff	33	A	So I've been looking at big corporations and saying the big corporation that I've worked for in the past had the pension plans had the big health care you had your insurance and you didn't have to pay in as much as if you go to a very small place
sw4644.dff	33	A	they don't have as good (as) insurance packages as big corporations
sw4644.dff	33	A	(And)
sw4644.dff	34	B	The only trouble we've had here in Massachusetts is the town and state employees
sw4644.dff	36	B	have run into problems especially the retired ones
sw4644.dff	36	B	My father's retired from the town of Framingham
sw4644.dff	37	A	(Sure)
sw4644.dff	38	B	and he said that they haven't gotten a cost of living raise
sw4644.dff	39	A	(No)
sw4644.dff	40	B	in over
sw4644.dff	42	B	five years
sw4644.dff	44	B	And he said that's the only thing that really stinks as far as being retired and
sw4644.dff	46	B	but I hear that bill is in the Senate now and (it's) hopefully
sw4644.dff	47	A	(Sure) (sure)
sw4644.dff	48	B	will go through
sw4644.dff	50	B	But I think (the) (schools) (are) (at) where the schools isn't just the school system
sw4644.dff	52	B	and not just the teachers
sw4644.dff	52	B	They took in the whole town (plus) (all)
sw4644.dff	53	A	Is it a union
sw4644.dff	54	B	we have the teachers union
sw4644.dff	56	B	which helps out a lot but the town of Framingham pays the benefits (and)
sw4644.dff	57	A	that's pretty good
sw4644.dff	58	B	that's all the town workers water and sewer
sw4644.dff	60	B	and where it's a very large town it's should be a city but they kept it a town
sw4644.dff	61	A	(Sure)
sw4644.dff	62	B	where it's extremely large they were able to offer a little bit more which was
sw4644.dff	64	B	really great because we don't have to pay a mayor
sw4644.dff	65	A	(I) (know) (what) (you) (mean) (and) (that's) (true)
sw4644.dff	65	A	it does end up being quite a bit when you have to hire somebody for that position (sure)
sw4644.dff	66	B	because most of (you) (know) the town employees as far as electoral positions are part-time
sw4644.dff	68	B	So it works out good because we
sw4644.dff	69	A	(Sure)
sw4644.dff	70	B	reap the benefits of it
sw4644.dff	72	B	but as far as shopping for a job I'd rather shop for the benefits than the salary
sw4644.dff	73	A	(that's) (it) and I've (kind) (of) looked around at that too
sw4644.dff	73	A	Because salary wise I don't think I'm making as much with a big corporation because I think when you look at big corps (or) (large) I'm talking hugh companies like Three M Honeywell Texas Instruments
sw4644.dff	75	A	I know people that have vacation times and benefits that I wouldn't even dream of in a small corporation
sw4644.dff	75	A	You bring it up to the owner and it's like come on Partly it's because the owner wants to keep getting richer (and) (richer)
sw4644.dff	77	A	and of course when it's a small corporation it also wants to expand so that money is spent
sw4646.dff	10	B	(put) (in) (there) (too)
sw4646.dff	10	B	(Because) I know my grandparents wanted to have some independence still
sw4646.dff	12	B	They wanted some place they can go and have their meals and a nurse on staff just in case they needed her (but) (they) (wanted) (to) (be) (independent) (as) (well)
sw4646.dff	14	B	Have their own room
sw4646.dff	15	A	My grandmother actually was in a nursing home that (there) was a retirement hotel and then a (there) (was) (some) (sort) (of) full-time care place that was also associated with it so for the first few years she had her own apartment and made her own meals sometimes
sw4646.dff	15	A	But could also go and eat someplace else
sw4646.dff	17	A	And then as she became less able to take care of herself (then) she moved into this other part that was able to provide full-time care and she didn't have to do anything anymore
sw4646.dff	17	A	(But) my experience has been that most people that move into nursing homes die very quickly
sw4646.dff	17	A	(And) (that's) (som-) I don't know whether that's because they sort of give up hope once they get in there or what the reason is
sw4646.dff	17	A	But I think the average length of time that somebody lives in a nursing home is only six months or something
sw4646.dff	18	B	a lot of it's probably to do with the fact that people go to it because they need help
sw4646.dff	20	B	They need health care so they're already ill before they go
sw4646.dff	22	B	That's probably a large factor
sw4646.dff	23	A	if you can take care of yourself at all or have someone that can take care of you then you stay where you are
sw4646.dff	23	A	(Then) you only go there as a last resort
sw4646.dff	25	A	Or people send you there as a last resort
sw4646.dff	26	B	(That's) (what) my grandparents it was just so that the rest of the relatives would have peace of mind knowing that if anything happened there was somebody there for them
sw4646.dff	28	B	(So) (that) (was) (their) (thinking)
sw4646.dff	28	B	Somebody who would know what to do in the event of an emergency
sw4646.dff	30	B	And also so they could find someplace that they enjoyed while they still had choices to make
sw4646.dff	32	B	So they wouldn't be stuck going into just whatever nursing home was available at the time
sw4646.dff	32	B	I guess that's a problem too for people
sw4646.dff	32	B	Wait lists and all
sw4646.dff	33	A	(I) (guess)
sw4646.dff	34	B	(That) you can't always get in when you want too and (of) (course) you can't just sit around and wait
sw4646.dff	35	A	When you need it (you) (need) (it)
sw4646.dff	37	A	(I) (guess)
sw4646.dff	38	B	And the money is also another issue
sw4646.dff	38	B	How you're going to pay for it
sw4646.dff	40	B	At that stage of life you only have so much money left and (I) (guess) it's not exactly fair for the younger family members to have to put it in their savings
sw4646.dff	42	B	it is kind of fair but it's also not fair because they have their own children to raise
sw4646.dff	43	A	(Sure)
sw4646.dff	44	B	So it's another problem
sw4646.dff	45	A	And if it were you you probably wouldn't want someone choosing a place for you to live based on lowest price
sw4646.dff	46	B	(So) it's just so complicated (anymore) (I) (think)
sw4646.dff	46	B	People outlive their savings
sw4646.dff	46	B	And with medicine being the way it is you're extending life where sometimes the quality of living has gone down and they're not necessarily enjoying life anymore
sw4646.dff	47	A	maybe that's the purpose of the nursing home is to have them go someplace where they can see that it's not worth continuing
sw4646.dff	48	B	It's just a shame that's the way it has to be
sw4646.dff	48	B	I think
sw4646.dff	50	B	the retirement home idea's a nice idea
sw4646.dff	50	B	To go and find older people and with similar interests and someplace to stay and cause if your spouse died all alone it'd be nice to go someplace with people similar to you
sw4646.dff	52	B	To have friends
sw4646.dff	53	A	I've known quite a few people that have gone to retirement communities
sw4646.dff	53	A	I don't know if they have them back there but here in California (and) (in) (Ari-)
sw4649.dff	1	A	I've had three boys through (I) (guess) some child care each one of them and now they're in school so it's all over but I guess I would say it's not easy to find what most parents would want
sw4649.dff	2	B	I can profit by this because I'm due with my first in about three months
sw4649.dff	3	A	(Is) (that) (I) (guess) the only rule I can think of is that I like to look for places with good respectable nonprofit behind them like a university or a hospital or something like that
sw4649.dff	3	A	If they're associated with a college or a university they're usually a pretty good bet
sw4649.dff	5	A	I think it's sort of the opposite of what you would want when you buy a car or refrigerator (something)
sw4649.dff	5	A	You'd like to get it from some good cutthroat capitalist company but not with child care
sw4649.dff	6	B	(I) (guess) not usu- I suppose you're absolutely there
sw4649.dff	7	A	For profit
sw4649.dff	9	A	places I would (really) look at them awfully carefully (but) when my kids were young I was teaching at a university and the child care center associated with our university was quite good so
sw4649.dff	11	A	I felt confident (that) (they'd) (do)
sw4649.dff	12	B	(Of) don't everybody kind of use them for guinea pigs
sw4649.dff	12	B	for their pet theories or some (such) thing
sw4649.dff	13	A	you mean learning type
sw4649.dff	14	B	(Yes)
sw4649.dff	15	A	actual experiments they would have to get your permission
sw4649.dff	15	A	(But) (I) (suppose) if there is a psychology department or an education department around you might find that they're pushing one form of education or another (I) (guess) (that's) (true)
sw4649.dff	15	A	But I never had bad experience in that respect
sw4649.dff	15	A	(Of) (course) you also tend to get people that are associated with the university and the hospital as the parents and they pretty good people
sw4649.dff	16	B	the thing I (really) worry about is the sexual abuse cases you read about
sw4649.dff	18	B	(And) you'd (just) feel awful if something like that happened
sw4649.dff	19	A	I never (really) worry very much about it
sw4649.dff	19	A	(I) (tend) (to) (think) (those) (are) (very) (rare) (but) (quickly) (exploited) (and) (made) (public) (so) (I)
sw4649.dff	21	A	(never) (really) (worried) (too) (much) (about) (that) (the) (case) (with) (my) (boys)
sw4649.dff	23	A	(you) (know) (I) (think) those things get into the headlines immediately when somebody finds out about them but
sw4649.dff	25	A	I don't think it's as common as the newspapers would make you believe
sw4649.dff	26	B	(And) another thing is cost
sw4649.dff	27	A	(I) (mean) (that)
sw4649.dff	28	B	(I) (know) (so) many of my friends I went to school with (who) are having babies now and in some cases they're finding it's just not worth it to work because it's all going out in daycare
sw4649.dff	31	A	in our case we made the decision that my wife would stay home until the boys were in school
sw4649.dff	31	A	And I'm (really) happy we did (it) although it was very (very) difficult
sw4649.dff	31	A	(And)
sw4649.dff	33	A	I think it was the thing to do and we just decided that we would do it and we went ahead but not everybody can make that choice and even though my wife wasn't working we did have one or another of the boys in child care just for part of the day
sw4649.dff	33	A	or a couple of days a week just so that other things could get done around the house (and) (so) (on) so
sw4649.dff	35	A	(So) we did look around
sw4649.dff	35	A	I think my wife is much better than I am at that walking into a place and getting a feeling for whether it is a loving and caring place or not and
sw4649.dff	37	A	so I would always trust her judgment on that
sw4649.dff	38	B	I'm just thanking heaven
sw4649.dff	38	B	My husband just got a new job
sw4649.dff	38	B	His last company he was only working four days a week
sw4649.dff	40	B	(So) (it's) and he just got a new job
sw4649.dff	40	B	He's getting lots of overtime he got a pay raise and so I'm just grateful that we don't have to worry so much about my working or not
sw4649.dff	41	A	There's absolutely no question that you're going to be the best child care provider for that kid so do it as long you can
sw4649.dff	42	B	(I) (suppose)
sw4649.dff	43	A	But I think you have to look through a place and you have to get a feel for how they treat the kids and what kind of staff members they have and
sw4649.dff	45	A	how much turnover they have and things like that before you
sw4649.dff	47	A	commit your child to them
sw4649.dff	47	A	And the main thing is that you have to determine that they're perfectly open
sw4649.dff	47	A	That you're welcome anytime without notice in the middle of the day and so forth and if they're at all queasy about that then
sw4649.dff	48	B	You have to start wondering if they don't want you
sw4649.dff	49	A	I'd look elsewhere
sw4649.dff	50	B	(Yes)
sw4649.dff	53	A	You have other friends that have kids being taken care of in child care
sw4649.dff	54	B	I have one but I haven't really had a chance to talk to her about that for a while
sw4649.dff	55	A	(But) I really think the news reports tend to sensationalize the problems
sw4649.dff	57	A	I think the problems are more ones of cost and resources and pay and exhaustion and
sw4649.dff	59	A	things like that rather than these really wild abuse cases that you read about because it make good copy
sw4649.dff	60	B	(This) (is) (true)
sw4649.dff	62	B	CURRENT AFFAIR can
sw4649.dff	64	B	get several shows child cases
sw4655.dff	1	A	Okay
sw4655.dff	1	A	just briefly
sw4655.dff	1	A	I worked in a nursing home so I kind of know from way back how things used to be run and I think there has been definite changes of nursing homes but I think if I had to personally put one of my parents in a nursing home they would have to be pretty bad off to where I couldn't take care of them at all
sw4655.dff	1	A	It would be something that (I) (would) (certainly) if they're forgetting things or whatever I'd prefer to have them at home or have them in what they call now home care
sw4655.dff	3	A	where somebody comes in and they cook meals and they clean their house for them that kind of thing so they still have their own independence (and) (not) (reliable) they don't have to be in a nursing home situation
sw4655.dff	3	A	But I (don't) think the nursing homes when I was working in them were very much understaffed very much in need of good personnel
sw4655.dff	3	A	I think the patients weren't given the quality of care that I wouldn't have I look at it and say thank God I got out of that (kind) (of) situation
sw4655.dff	3	A	But
sw4655.dff	5	A	they were not given the time and they were not given the money basically to staff appropriately people to help
sw4655.dff	7	A	And I can remember lifting a patient all by myself simply because there was not another person to help
sw4655.dff	7	A	It's either leave the patient in bed all day long or get them up and I would have preferred to get them up than to leave them in bed all day
sw4655.dff	7	A	so I think nursing homes have changed
sw4655.dff	7	A	I'm not quite sure but hopefully they have
sw4655.dff	8	B	I guess I haven't had that much experience
sw4655.dff	8	B	I've only seen my great grandparents in a nursing home
sw4655.dff	10	B	but
sw4655.dff	12	B	I have an aunt who lived on her own until she was well in her nineties
sw4655.dff	13	A	(Sure)
sw4655.dff	14	B	and then she got sick and she ended up in nursing home
sw4655.dff	16	B	and my parents went to visit her and it got to the point where it seemed like the nursing home didn't want to deal wi- her anymore
sw4655.dff	17	A	(Sure)
sw4655.dff	18	B	and so they gave her drugs to keep her asleep
sw4655.dff	19	A	I think that can happen and I think in the nursing home that I worked for I wasn't quite sure of it but I'm sure that some of the patients were given medication to keep them quiet (and)
sw4655.dff	20	B	(Nice) (sedative) (state)
sw4655.dff	21	A	And they would just lay all day long and (the) (ones) (tha-) (they) (also) (put) (mentally) (ill) (patients) (in) (the) (same) they were not on the same ward but they were in the same nursing home so these mentally ill patients could walk into where the other older people that were in there for reasons of age the mentally ill patients could walk into the rooms or do whatever they wanted to basically
sw4655.dff	21	A	Because if you weren't there to watch them and keep them in their own wing they had freedom to just walk around and I think there was a couple that were schizophrenic and I remember one time watching one of the schizophrenic patients actually go out on I don't know what they call it a binge or whatever you want to say (it)
sw4655.dff	23	A	(she) (grabbed) (a) (hold) (of) (this) (and) it was kind of funny when I looked back at it but I remember the patient getting very upset
sw4655.dff	23	A	That woman actually pulled the other person's hair
sw4655.dff	23	A	she just came up behind him and pulled his hair and it was a guy that was just really upset
sw4655.dff	23	A	he said what the hell are you think you're doing and I laughed at it then but then I'm thinking God if I had to put my parents in that nursing home I wouldn't want them there
sw4655.dff	23	A	So
sw4655.dff	25	A	I think there's laws now That nursing homes either have to keep the mentally ill totally away from these people and not in the same type of facilities even though they're aging mentally ill they are still mentally ill and a lot of these older people (you) (know) they're not insane or anything like that
sw4655.dff	25	A	They don't have these tendencies to lash out
sw4655.dff	26	B	(To) (be) (violent)
sw4655.dff	27	A	But seeing that (kind) (of) made me think twice about (jeez) I wouldn't put my mother father in that nursing home at all
sw4655.dff	28	B	Was this in a big town or a little town
sw4655.dff	29	A	A small town
sw4655.dff	30	B	really
sw4655.dff	32	B	Because it seems like the small town nursing homes (there's) (a)
sw4655.dff	33	A	(I) (don't) (know)
sw4655.dff	34	B	lot more personal attention
sw4655.dff	35	A	(I) (don't) (know)
sw4655.dff	35	A	I kind of look at it this way
sw4655.dff	35	A	I think if you have a big city area I think there's more people to keep watch on it
sw4655.dff	36	B	You have
sw4655.dff	37	A	(And)
sw4655.dff	38	B	more options
sw4655.dff	39	A	And you have more competition
sw4655.dff	39	A	And I think nursing homes have to be better than when there's one nursing home for a whole community
sw4655.dff	39	A	And this is back in nineteen seventy-seven that I worked there
sw4655.dff	41	A	and I look back at it and say (jeez) it would have to be awfully bad for me to put my parents in there
sw4655.dff	41	A	But my grandmother later on got cancer (and) (could) (no) (longer) (actually) (she)
sw4659.dff	1	A	What do you think
sw4659.dff	2	B	I can't be terribly authoritative on what life was like thirty years ago because I'm not that old yet
sw4659.dff	5	A	I can be but go ahead
sw4659.dff	6	B	(I) (know) (that) obviously you look at the technological aspect of social change
sw4659.dff	6	B	you didn't have video games
sw4659.dff	6	B	You didn't have home computers
sw4659.dff	6	B	You didn't have Xerox machines
sw4659.dff	8	B	(you) (try) (to) you go into a business today and you try to imagine the whole thing except running off of carbon paper and it's almost inconceivable now because the Xerox machines and everything have become such a part of the way we live
sw4659.dff	9	A	We fax
sw4659.dff	10	B	(And)
sw4659.dff	11	A	everything
sw4659.dff	13	A	We don't even wait for the mail anymore
sw4659.dff	16	B	a business associate of mine was talking about how it used to be where you would send things through the mail and you had to do something this was concerning the S E C and so if they had business to do they had to finish it three days in advance so they could get it through the mail
sw4659.dff	18	B	And now it's the kind of thing where you can work up until the last minute
sw4659.dff	20	B	Because you can get it there
sw4659.dff	22	B	in a matter of minutes
sw4659.dff	24	B	through a fax machine and because of that these quote unquote convenience type items have made work that much more intense and that much harder
sw4659.dff	26	B	Because you're expected to work on stuff up until the last minute
sw4659.dff	27	A	(You're) (expected) (to) (exactly)
sw4659.dff	27	A	(And) I recently read an article on just this that said stress today is so much worse
sw4659.dff	27	A	It should be less because we have a microwave and our grandmothers had to bake brownies and we can throw them in a microwave for two minutes but the more conveniences we have the more that's expected of us
sw4659.dff	29	A	and we have no down time
sw4659.dff	29	A	we don't stop and wait for things to happen because we don't have to
sw4659.dff	31	A	So we keep moving
sw4659.dff	31	A	We don't stop and wait for the things to bake and this to happen and that to happen
sw4659.dff	31	A	We just hit buttons and keep going to the next thing
sw4659.dff	31	A	So we have no relaxation time in between
sw4659.dff	33	A	so they say that's really a bad thing
sw4659.dff	33	A	That you need to learn a lot of ways to deal with that and get your time in between things
sw4659.dff	35	A	So that's good
sw4659.dff	35	A	That's an interesting point
sw4659.dff	35	A	But I just think our family lives have changed drastically
sw4659.dff	37	A	(And) (I) (think) (that's) (ju-) of course a part of it is technology
sw4659.dff	37	A	our kids where would they be without Nintendo and their T V shows and (no-) some of that is really bad I think
sw4659.dff	37	A	But we have all single families
sw4659.dff	37	A	So many single families now
sw4659.dff	37	A	a lot of working both parents are working
sw4659.dff	37	A	So there's a whole big effect on our kids and not very many of my daughter's friends really are on their original mother and father
sw4659.dff	37	A	I'm wondering what this is going to do in ten and twenty years
sw4660.dff	1	A	(Okay)
sw4660.dff	1	A	How do you get your news mostly
sw4660.dff	2	B	(Generally) I get most of my news from the radio
sw4660.dff	2	B	(And) (then) (sometimes) if I've got time I'll be reading the front page of the newspaper
sw4660.dff	4	B	and (just) (fall) (off) (on) the articles that I like
sw4660.dff	6	B	also since my wife likes to watch T V (sometimes) (just) (being) (there) (you) (know) I have to watch the news late at night
sw4660.dff	8	B	(with) (T) (V)
sw4660.dff	10	B	How about you
sw4660.dff	11	A	I can hardly wait for my morning paper to come
sw4660.dff	13	A	(So) (that's) the first thing I want is the headlines
sw4660.dff	13	A	It's really funny because my sister grabs the sports and I grab the headlines
sw4660.dff	15	A	(and) (then) when five o'clock comes around I just want to get in the house and turn the T V on to watch the news
sw4660.dff	17	A	(It's) (really) (weird)
sw4660.dff	17	A	I don't stay up late to watch (late) news because my eyes won't stay up that long
sw4660.dff	17	A	But I love to watch the five o'clock news and makes me angry when my paper boy's not there on time where I can read my paper
sw4660.dff	19	A	I do have my radio going most of the day (though) so about every hour it breaks in and gives me news too
sw4660.dff	20	B	(Okay)
sw4660.dff	20	B	Do you
sw4660.dff	21	A	(But)
sw4660.dff	22	B	get like one of the news stations
sw4660.dff	23	A	No
sw4660.dff	23	A	I just have a channel that has music except for every hour say eight o'clock nine
sw4660.dff	24	B	(Sure)
sw4660.dff	25	A	o'clock they come on for just a little bit of the news
sw4660.dff	27	A	(But) (as) (far) (as) (the) (actual) (news) (I) (get) (that) (from) (the) (can) (you) (hold) (on) (just) (for) (a) (second)
sw4660.dff	28	B	(Sure)
sw4660.dff	29	A	(Just) (a) (minute)
sw4660.dff	29	A	(Hello) (sir)
sw4660.dff	30	B	(Yes)
sw4660.dff	31	A	(Yes) (I'm) (sorry) (to) (keep) (you) (waiting)
sw4660.dff	32	B	(Okay)
sw4660.dff	33	A	(I) (was) (calling) (from) (work) (and) (that) (was) (a) (call) (waiting)
sw4660.dff	34	B	it sounds like you like the news a lot more than I do
sw4660.dff	34	B	(I) (figure) if it's something really important somebody will tell me about it
sw4660.dff	34	B	(But) (the) (thing) (is) if I catch the news all the time it just makes me depressed because they tend to produce a lot of bad news
sw4660.dff	34	B	(Or) (that's) (what)
sw4660.dff	35	A	(yo-)
sw4660.dff	36	B	comes on first
sw4660.dff	37	A	(That's) (true) (too)
sw4660.dff	38	B	And also late at night I don't like watching the news late at night but my wife is usually up then and so
sw4660.dff	40	B	I can't go to sleep with the T V on
sw4660.dff	42	B	(I) (but) I wish I had more news on things like that I consider long range
sw4660.dff	42	B	Things like science and medicine
sw4660.dff	44	B	(I) (guess) I'm more into science and science fiction and (there's) not that the news is science fiction but I'm more interested in that
sw4660.dff	44	B	Things like is NASA ready for another space shot
sw4660.dff	44	B	how hot are they on the trail of a cure for such and such cancer
sw4660.dff	46	B	and a lot of the news isn't that interesting to me
sw4660.dff	47	A	(you're) There is a lot of it that's just garbage as far as I'm concerned
sw4660.dff	49	A	But I just like the daily news
sw4660.dff	51	A	(Just) especially the weather
sw4660.dff	51	A	(I) (like) (that)
sw4660.dff	52	B	(Me) (too)
sw4660.dff	53	A	Although they're usually wrong
sw4660.dff	54	B	Georgia here they're usually wrong too
sw4660.dff	54	B	We have weird weather systems
sw4660.dff	55	A	But (like) (I) (say) as far as actually listening to the news it's mostly T V five o'clock to six thirty
sw4660.dff	55	A	that seems like a long time for news but that's how long it is
sw4660.dff	57	A	And seems like they have the local news and they have the world news
sw4660.dff	59	A	And then my morning paper
sw4660.dff	59	A	I can hardly wait for it to come
sw4660.dff	60	B	(I'm)
sw4660.dff	61	A	(And)
sw4660.dff	62	B	I would I'm not a morning person so I would begrudge the time it takes me in the morning to catch my morning news
sw4660.dff	64	B	I get up just barely in time to get up get ready and get off to work and then at work
sw4660.dff	66	B	I have no time to read the news
sw4660.dff	67	A	Once you get to work I wouldn't either
sw4660.dff	68	B	(No)
sw4660.dff	69	A	But I've always been a morning person to get up
sw4660.dff	71	A	but I can't stay up late at night to watch the late news so
sw4660.dff	71	A	I guess that's why I watch it at five o'clock
sw4660.dff	73	A	(But) (anyhow)
sw4660.dff	73	A	(listen) (I) (guess) (that's) (about) (it) (then)
sw4660.dff	74	B	(Okay)
sw4660.dff	75	A	It's been nice talking to you Tony
sw4660.dff	76	B	Nice talking to you
sw4660.dff	76	B	I'll probably talk to you again
sw4660.dff	76	B	I had a friend who was in this and he said that he got calls from the same caller sometimes
sw4660.dff	77	A	really
sw4660.dff	79	A	that hasn't happened to me yet
sw4660.dff	79	A	So you never know it might this time
sw4660.dff	80	B	(That's)
sw4660.dff	81	A	(Okay) (Tony)
sw4660.dff	82	B	(Take) (it) (easy)
sw4660.dff	83	A	(Bye-bye)
sw4660.dff	84	B	(Bye-bye)
sw4666.dff	1	B	Actually like I said I'm in Minneapolis and the big thing up here of course is the twins
sw4666.dff	2	A	I imagine you can't escape it
sw4666.dff	3	B	No it's pretty pervasive
sw4666.dff	3	B	It kind of goes into about all aspects of society I think up here
sw4666.dff	3	B	But actually I don't know how much of the World Series you caught last year but that was a lot of fun
sw4666.dff	4	A	(of) (course) (it) (was) (fun) (for) (you)
sw4666.dff	5	B	to be honest with you I'm not from Minneapolis
sw4666.dff	5	B	In fact I've only been up here a few months and I'm going back at the end of next month
sw4666.dff	6	A	To
sw4666.dff	7	B	Orlando Florida
sw4666.dff	8	A	(really)
sw4666.dff	9	B	So I'm not exactly a real Twins fan from birth or anything
sw4666.dff	9	B	(But)
sw4666.dff	10	A	I was born and raised near Miami and spent the
sw4666.dff	12	A	last twenty years in Dallas
sw4666.dff	14	A	where the Rangers played
sw4666.dff	16	A	And for the
sw4666.dff	18	A	(last) (what) (roughly) (year) I've been in San Francisco where there are two teams
sw4666.dff	18	A	The Oakland A -s and the San Francisco Giants
sw4666.dff	20	A	(but) (honestly) I do my duty and watch the sports on
sw4666.dff	22	A	the newscasts
sw4666.dff	23	B	(okay)
sw4666.dff	24	A	but that's about all the exposure I have to sports
sw4666.dff	25	B	I haven't followed it real closely at all
sw4666.dff	25	B	except (like) (I) (said) last year when the World Series rolled around I did follow that pretty religiously
sw4666.dff	25	B	Went out into the bars
sw4666.dff	27	B	drank a beer watched the game had a good time that way
sw4666.dff	28	A	(sure)
sw4666.dff	29	B	(But)
sw4666.dff	30	A	(I) (guess) the San Francisco Giants and the Oakland A -s were the leading teams a couple of years ago
sw4666.dff	31	B	(Is) (that)
sw4666.dff	32	A	(I) (th-) (I) (don't) (know)
sw4666.dff	32	A	That's sort of what I gather
sw4666.dff	34	A	(and) (I) (don't) (know)
sw4666.dff	34	A	What is the prognosis for this year
sw4666.dff	35	B	real good as far as I can tell
sw4666.dff	35	B	People are pretty excited about it
sw4666.dff	36	A	(Good)
sw4666.dff	36	A	(I) (assume) (that) (means) (good) (for) (the) (Minnesota)
sw4666.dff	39	B	(Sorry) (about) (that) as far as the Twins are concerned it seems to be real good
sw4666.dff	41	B	my roommate went and saw them play on their season opener a couple of nights ago and they won that one seven to one (so) that's pretty good (I) (guess)
sw4666.dff	41	B	It looks like they'll be doing pretty well
sw4666.dff	41	B	(Are) (you) (still) (there)
sw4666.dff	43	B	(Okay)
sw4666.dff	43	B	(I) (heard) (some) (noise) (on) (the) (line)
sw4666.dff	43	B	(Didn't) (know) (what) (happened)
sw4666.dff	44	A	(I) (think) (a) (train) (went) (by)
sw4666.dff	45	B	(okay)
sw4666.dff	45	B	(All)
sw4666.dff	46	A	(I) (know) (a) (train) (went) (by) (I) (don't) (know) (what) (the) (noise) (was) (but) (I) (think) (it) (probably) (was) (the) (train)
sw4666.dff	48	A	(I) (don't) (know)
sw4666.dff	48	A	I don't even know who has been winning as far as the San Francisco Giants and the Oakland A -s but I think they both won their opener
sw4666.dff	48	A	I (sort) (of) gathered that in my subliminal memory
sw4666.dff	49	B	maybe that has good tidings for their season coming up
sw4666.dff	49	B	I've actually got a friend that's living in San Francisco now
sw4666.dff	49	B	he's doing the same thing I'm doing which is basically an internship
sw4666.dff	49	B	we're both doctoral students and he's
sw4666.dff	51	B	doing his with I B M and I'm doing mine with Honeywell
sw4666.dff	51	B	But I think he (kind) (of) follows the sports and I think he's mentioned the Oakland A -s a couple of times
sw4666.dff	53	B	he may have watched them and seemed to think that they were pretty good
sw4666.dff	54	A	I guess they are different leagues
sw4666.dff	54	A	Is that The A -s
sw4666.dff	55	B	As far as I know
sw4666.dff	57	B	And in the major leagues I guess there is a couple of different divisions and then of course there's the minors
sw4666.dff	57	B	(I) (don't) (know)
sw4666.dff	57	B	(I) (guess) I'm one of those people that if I really made a concentrated effort I could really probably get into baseball
sw4666.dff	59	B	but I was talking to my roommate a couple of nights ago after that game and he offered to take me to one of the games because (apparently) he and four other people from Honeywell had bought (or) a row of seats (actually) for the home games
sw4666.dff	61	B	But the thing is there's like eighty-six home games per year
sw4666.dff	61	B	So there's no way that you can ever use them all
sw4666.dff	62	A	Eighty-six
sw4666.dff	63	B	(Eighty-six)
sw4666.dff	63	B	I was amazed to hear that
sw4666.dff	65	B	that's just the home games and I thought it was a mistake but (he) (goes) no
sw4666.dff	66	A	they must play every day then
sw4666.dff	67	B	just about
sw4666.dff	68	A	(eighty-six) (times) (two)
sw4666.dff	70	A	(is) (a) (hundred) (sixty)
sw4666.dff	71	B	(And) (you) (know) (that's) (almost)
sw4666.dff	72	A	(And) (Lord) that's over five months (worth)
sw4666.dff	73	B	(That's) (a) (lot) (of) (baseball)
sw4666.dff	74	A	(Even) (if) (they) (play) (every) (day) (that's) (over) (five) (months) (worth)
sw4666.dff	75	B	if you consider it (the) (season) (starts) (it's) the season started about a week and a half ago and it ends with the World Series which usually takes place (I) (believe) in December or January
sw4666.dff	76	A	No
sw4666.dff	77	B	(I) (think) (so)
sw4666.dff	77	B	It did last year didn't it
sw4666.dff	77	B	Or was it November
sw4666.dff	78	A	That was the Super Bowl
sw4666.dff	79	B	(Maybe) (it) (was) (November) (I'm) (thinking) (about)
sw4666.dff	79	B	I know it was doggone cold up here
sw4666.dff	80	A	I don't feel so bad
sw4666.dff	80	A	I think you don't know all that much more than I do about baseball
sw4666.dff	81	B	I know for sure it was I know it was after September
sw4666.dff	83	B	Because that's when I got up here
sw4666.dff	84	A	I (see) (okay)
sw4666.dff	85	B	and it was at least two months after I got up here
sw4666.dff	86	A	(really) (okay)
sw4666.dff	87	B	so it had to be November anyway
sw4666.dff	88	A	(I) (know) (the) (Super) (Bowl)
sw4675.dff	1	B	All rightie
sw4675.dff	2	A	Okay
sw4675.dff	2	A	Do you have a budget that you go on
sw4675.dff	3	B	I sure do
sw4675.dff	3	B	it's pretty much a ledger sheet and I just write down all my bills how much I'm going to have to pay and I do it per paycheck for me
sw4675.dff	5	B	which is every other week
sw4675.dff	7	B	I include everything from groceries to insurance to car payments to credit card payments everything
sw4675.dff	9	B	And it tends to work out pretty well that way
sw4675.dff	9	B	I can anticipate a little better
sw4675.dff	9	B	I usually try to guesstimate and then when the bill actually comes in I go ahead and fill in the actual amount
sw4675.dff	11	B	That way I know how much pocket change I'm going to have left at the end of the month
sw4675.dff	13	B	or at the end of the paycheck anyway
sw4675.dff	15	B	that works okay for me
sw4675.dff	16	A	my bills I usually know approximately how much they're going to be
sw4675.dff	18	A	Each month they are more or less just about the same
sw4675.dff	19	B	same here
sw4675.dff	20	A	very seldom are they any different
sw4675.dff	20	A	And then for groceries and everything we try to put two hundred and fifty dollars in a little can in the kitchen
sw4675.dff	22	A	and then that's what we use to buy the groceries with
sw4675.dff	23	B	(okay)
sw4675.dff	24	A	And then we put our receipts in there and usually that's enough
sw4675.dff	26	A	but I don't have any small children to have anything extra come up (like) running to the doctor or something like that with them
sw4675.dff	27	B	Luckily I don't either
sw4675.dff	29	B	maybe my cat would get sick but usually that's not so much that it would throw me off
sw4675.dff	30	A	(In) (fact) I did have to take my dog to the vet the other day
sw4675.dff	31	B	so you know what I'm saying
sw4675.dff	32	A	it's worse than having a kid
sw4675.dff	33	B	(I) sometimes it can be
sw4675.dff	35	B	Sometimes it can be
sw4675.dff	35	B	(I) (guess) the worst thing I've ever had come out is car maintenance kinds of things
sw4675.dff	37	B	But I do try to build in a little extra money each month to be able to do that type of thing so
sw4675.dff	38	A	I'm not working now
sw4675.dff	38	A	I worked for P I E and then they went bankrupt so
sw4675.dff	40	A	I just went ahead and took my early pension
sw4675.dff	42	A	But I only get that once a month
sw4675.dff	43	B	that's tough
sw4675.dff	45	B	My roommate only gets paid once a month and
sw4675.dff	46	A	(So)
sw4675.dff	47	B	that last week's pretty lean generally speaking (so)
sw4675.dff	48	A	So I really have to try to budget that I don't go over that amount each month
sw4675.dff	49	B	(I) for years got paid once a month and in ways I liked it because I could go ahead and pay all my bills at once
sw4675.dff	51	B	There's always one or two stragglers (that) (usually) (they) (were) for me it worked out that they were the smaller ones
sw4675.dff	53	B	but I would pay all of them at one sitting and I would know okay you can go spend this much on groceries now and you get this much a week and that is it
sw4675.dff	55	B	and it worked okay for me
sw4675.dff	57	B	(I) (don't) (know)
sw4675.dff	58	A	(And)
sw4675.dff	59	B	now I'm in the mode of trying to dig out of debt I think as everybody is and so
sw4675.dff	60	A	now it's terrible isn't it
sw4675.dff	61	B	it's really bad
sw4675.dff	63	B	But it's going pretty well and I've got a real good plan mapped out here (so)
sw4675.dff	64	A	I also like long-term Christmas club (you) (know)
sw4675.dff	64	A	I used to belong to a Christmas club last year I didn't
sw4675.dff	66	A	so then naturally Christmas comes along and that puts you behind too So this year I have them taking out fifty dollars a month out of my
sw4675.dff	67	B	(that's)
sw4675.dff	68	A	checking account for my Christmas club
sw4675.dff	70	A	So I figure that's going to help some
sw4675.dff	71	B	That'll cover your gifts come Christmas time
sw4675.dff	71	B	(That'll)
sw4675.dff	73	B	(That'll) be good most people are spending three or four months you know at least digging out after Christmas (so)
sw4675.dff	74	A	(And) (I'm) (ta-)
sw4675.dff	75	B	I was pretty fortunate this Christmas I didn't get in debt (so)
sw4675.dff	76	A	(that's) (good)
sw4675.dff	76	A	I'm taking (like) sewing lessons to try to learn how to sew better than what I can
sw4675.dff	78	A	so I won't have to go out and buy the ready-made clothes anymore
sw4675.dff	79	B	It's so rare you hear anybody doing that any longer
sw4675.dff	80	A	I know
sw4675.dff	80	A	I even bought myself a Surgery and I just love it
sw4675.dff	80	A	I haven't learned everything to do on it yet but I figure that will help me save
sw4675.dff	83	B	My roommate does sew some and she hasn't sewed anything in a long time but I'm sure that she could pick it up again
sw4675.dff	85	B	My mother always sewed
sw4675.dff	85	B	She tried to teach me when I was young but
sw4675.dff	87	B	not interested
sw4675.dff	88	A	some people are some aren't because
sw4675.dff	90	A	I have three sisters and none of those are really interested in sewing
sw4675.dff	91	B	But that's a real good way to save money
sw4675.dff	93	B	though by doing that
sw4675.dff	94	A	and then I can also do some crafts and sell those at garage sales
sw4675.dff	96	A	which I've been doing
sw4675.dff	97	B	that's a good way to a little extra money
sw4675.dff	99	B	this is another way that I'm making a little extra money so that was nice that I tripped over this opportunity and you're actually my first call
sw4675.dff	100	A	really
sw4675.dff	103	B	I (had) (not) (done) (I) (guess) (today)
sw4675.dff	104	A	have you called
sw4675.dff	105	B	today's my first day that I could
sw4675.dff	107	B	even do it
sw4675.dff	108	A	(it) (is)
sw4675.dff	109	B	you beat me to the punch here
sw4675.dff	110	A	(that's) (nice)
sw4679.dff	1	A	Why don't you go ahead and start
sw4679.dff	2	B	(Okay)
sw4679.dff	2	B	I think the court systems could stand some improvement
sw4679.dff	2	B	trial by jury is good but a lot of cases is circumstantial evidence that convicts a person which I don't think is all the time good
sw4679.dff	2	B	Because sometimes it's hard to get all the facts and to (I) (mean) prove a person guilty if you don't really know or you don't really have an eyewitness
sw4679.dff	2	B	And how can you convict somebody on circumstantial evidence is beyond me
sw4679.dff	2	B	(I) (don't) (know)
sw4679.dff	3	A	So you think if trials were held by judges or experts that they would tend not to convict people on circumstantial evidence
sw4679.dff	4	B	I think so
sw4679.dff	5	A	I attended a trial in Germany when I was a student and
sw4679.dff	7	A	that's the sort of system they have
sw4679.dff	7	A	The trials are held by a panel of three or four judges who are (they're) lawyers I guess
sw4679.dff	7	A	They're experts in the law
sw4679.dff	9	A	(and) there really isn't a jury and they do the questioning also
sw4679.dff	9	A	The judges do the questioning and
sw4679.dff	11	A	(they) (i-) (I) (think) it's a lot harder to get off on technicalities also because the judge is also sort of a jury but I'm not sure I like that
sw4679.dff	11	A	(I) (think) I prefer the jury system myself
sw4679.dff	12	B	You think you prefer the jury
sw4679.dff	12	B	(You) (think) your chances are better
sw4679.dff	13	A	(I) (think) in most criminal cases it wouldn't make any difference whether it was a couple of judges or jury
sw4679.dff	13	A	what I worry about is cases where it's the government against the individual
sw4679.dff	13	A	That's where you really need a jury of peers
sw4679.dff	14	B	(that's) (true)
sw4679.dff	15	A	Because anytime the government is (the) (government) against the individual you need the protection of ordinary citizens
sw4679.dff	15	A	(I) (think) that's really the only thing
sw4679.dff	15	A	(I) (guess) where I would like to see the system change (is) (there) (ought) (to) (be) (a) (I) (guess) (I) (don't) (think) (that) juries (need) to decide sentencing all the time
sw4679.dff	17	A	(I) (think) maybe a judge is a better judge of that (or)
sw4679.dff	18	B	sometimes the sentencing is not fair
sw4679.dff	18	B	even if the jury (I) (guess) (they) do decide that but I'm like you in a case like that most of the time (its) (I) (don't) (know) (maybe) (I'm) (too) conservative when it comes to that
sw4679.dff	18	B	the sentencing is really light compared to what I think they should be in a lot of cases
sw4679.dff	21	A	if you drag twelve people into a courtroom I trust them to make the decision as to whether someone's guilty or innocent
sw4679.dff	21	A	That's usually a matter of who to believe and what facts to believe
sw4679.dff	23	A	But people who don't have day in and day out life long experience with what prison is really like and what the options are to ask them to decide for one case on one person based on what they see I think that is maybe a little bit naive
sw4679.dff	25	A	In Texas here people tend to get whipped up into a frenzy and slap long sentences on people
sw4679.dff	27	A	it's (kind) (of) a hanging jury atmosphere
sw4679.dff	29	A	But in a lot of places I think people bend over the other way but (I) (guess) I like the system that they have in some places where the defendant goes before a jury for sentencing or whether the judge gets to choose it
sw4679.dff	29	A	some cases in some jurisdictions they can do that
sw4679.dff	30	B	(really)
sw4679.dff	31	A	(I) kind of (like) (that) (system)
sw4679.dff	32	B	that's not a bad system
sw4679.dff	32	B	But I do think it needs to be shaken up a little bit
sw4679.dff	34	B	But the thing is too maybe they need (I) (don't) (know) more of a expert types
sw4679.dff	36	B	to be on some of these jury cases because most time you just pick Joe Blow or whoever and a good citizen or whoever
sw4679.dff	38	B	and call them in
sw4679.dff	39	A	And lawyers blow sand in their eyes
sw4679.dff	40	B	(exactly)
sw4679.dff	41	A	I would like to see most civil cases tried before a panel of experts instead of ordinary juries
sw4679.dff	42	B	(exactly)
sw4679.dff	43	A	Insurance cases and things like that
sw4679.dff	45	A	Where (and) there would be more honest settlements instead of this tugging of people's heart strings and
sw4679.dff	47	A	making them cry and feel like they're doing somebody good by giving them
sw4679.dff	48	B	(putting) (on) (a) (act) (or) (whatever)
sw4679.dff	49	A	giving them two million dollars to make up for the pain and suffering
sw4679.dff	50	B	(Exactly) (exactly)
sw4679.dff	51	A	So
sw4679.dff	51	A	I think in criminal trials you need the jury as a defense against the government but
sw4681.dff	1	A	taxes
sw4681.dff	1	A	Do you want to go ahead
sw4681.dff	2	B	Sure
sw4681.dff	2	B	We pay far too much in taxes
sw4681.dff	2	B	far too much for what we get
sw4681.dff	4	B	(it's) (just)
sw4681.dff	5	A	(I) (agree)
sw4681.dff	6	B	(I) (don't) (know) it just seems too much of the money is just lost
sw4681.dff	7	A	I think when I look at all the things that are coming out now about over spending and spending money that's not there and buying things that are extremely expensive where they could buy it at a better discount (when)
sw4681.dff	8	B	You mean like those twenty thousand dollar toilets
sw4681.dff	9	A	(Exactly) (exactly)
sw4681.dff	9	A	That's exactly the whole thing
sw4681.dff	9	A	When you take a look at all those issues of where our money is going and it's just as long as the person that's spending the money doesn't think about I can go out and spend anything that I want to (it's) (just) (unlimited)
sw4681.dff	10	B	(Sure) it's real easy to spend other people's money
sw4681.dff	11	A	An unlimited source so they think I'll go out and buy a four hundred toilet seat and I could have went to K-Mart and bought it for ten or fifteen
sw4681.dff	11	A	that kind of thing (and)
sw4681.dff	12	B	I don't mind them getting what they need
sw4681.dff	12	B	It's just when they pay so much for it
sw4681.dff	13	A	(Exactly)
sw4681.dff	14	B	It takes very little to just shop around (and)
sw4681.dff	15	A	(Exactly)
sw4681.dff	15	A	And I know a lot of corporations now are looking at their amount of money that's being spent and they're looking
sw4681.dff	16	B	(That's) (true)
sw4681.dff	17	A	at what's the best buy
sw4681.dff	17	A	It used to be if you had a company you had to go through certain people and you didn't care what you paid
sw4681.dff	19	A	I mean you just got it done
sw4681.dff	19	A	Now people are putting in bids for things and are looking at things
sw4681.dff	19	A	Going to actually shop at Best Buy (for) Best Buy is one of our electronic stores
sw4681.dff	21	A	for fax machines things like that instead of going through these office supply companies that mark up their amounts and say I'll give you a legal pad for five bucks
sw4681.dff	23	A	and you can go to another shop and get it for maybe sixty cents or ninety cents
sw4681.dff	25	A	(that) (kind) (of) (thing) (so)
sw4681.dff	26	B	I'm also wondering why our taxes are still so high considering the world's probably in better shape now than it has been in the last fifty years
sw4681.dff	27	A	Except for everything keeps going up
sw4681.dff	29	A	And I know as a middle class and also I have one dependent has
sw4681.dff	31	A	my daughter and I keep looking at where's the so-called tax relief
sw4681.dff	32	B	(I) (know)
sw4681.dff	33	A	for having children
sw4681.dff	33	A	there is none
sw4681.dff	33	A	I think I paid just as much as when
sw4681.dff	34	B	(I) (know) (I) (don't) (even)
sw4681.dff	35	A	I didn't have her (so)
sw4681.dff	36	B	I don't even get to see half my paycheck
sw4681.dff	38	B	Between Four One K and the thirty-four percent they're taking out for taxes
sw4681.dff	39	A	(Sure)
sw4681.dff	39	A	(Exactly)
sw4681.dff	40	B	Let alone what I end up having to pay
sw4681.dff	41	A	(Exactly)
sw4681.dff	41	A	(that's) (the) (whole) (thing)
sw4681.dff	41	A	Now they have gotten this wonderful idea of not taking out as much taxes
sw4681.dff	43	A	but you're still going to owe the government as much money
sw4681.dff	44	B	(Sure)
sw4681.dff	45	A	so by the end of this coming year (what's) (going) (to) (happen) (is) all these people are going to find out that they owe the government and it certainly isn't going to be in their savings account
sw4681.dff	46	B	(Nope) (they) (won't) (be) (able) (to) (pay)
sw4681.dff	47	A	They won't be able to pay it and there'll be a lot of problems because of that (Put) (people) (into) January or February which is always suppose to be (the) (month) (after) (Christmas) (is) (supposed) (to) (be) high spending because everything is on sale
sw4681.dff	49	A	Nobody's going to have the money to spend
sw4681.dff	50	B	(Sure) (none)
sw4681.dff	51	A	They're going to be paying (on) their taxes so they're going to have to (just) cut back so I don't know where the answer is (and)
sw4681.dff	52	B	(I) (don't) (in) (the) (first) (place) there's also taxation without representation
sw4681.dff	52	B	I don't feel represented anymore (in) (our) (government)
sw4681.dff	52	B	(it)
sw4681.dff	54	B	it's certainly not a government for me
sw4681.dff	54	B	It doesn't take care of my needs
sw4681.dff	55	A	(No) (no)
sw4681.dff	55	A	(that's) (the) (whole) (thing)
sw4681.dff	55	A	(I) (think) people are getting so fed up with it
sw4681.dff	55	A	Now we go through another election and listen to all these lies (about) (the)
sw4681.dff	56	B	and people don't care anymore either
sw4681.dff	57	A	(No)
sw4681.dff	57	A	(No)
sw4681.dff	58	B	People don't want to go out to vote
sw4681.dff	59	A	I don't think people think they can make a difference
sw4681.dff	59	A	(And) (when) (you've) (got) (candidates) (as) (you) (do)
sw4681.dff	59	A	(It's) (candidates) (that) (have) (money)
sw4681.dff	61	A	(and) it's backed by big business
sw4681.dff	61	A	And big business says we don't care about the little person and you're not going to get anymore Abe Lincolns
sw4681.dff	62	B	(No) (but)
sw4681.dff	63	A	around
sw4681.dff	64	B	(but) (that) that's going to backfire because
sw4681.dff	65	A	who knows
sw4681.dff	66	B	little people (who) buy everything (so)
sw4681.dff	67	A	Generations from now we might set back in our little rocking chairs and watch our grandchildren go through an entirely different system (of) (things) and say this government itself isn't working
sw4681.dff	67	A	Just like the communist government of the old U S S R
sw4681.dff	69	A	And maybe that's going to happen to America (where) they'll say hey we're fed up
sw4681.dff	70	B	I wonder though
sw4681.dff	71	A	Maybe it'll have to be just individual state tax
sw4681.dff	73	A	And each state take care of itself and no government (type) (of) where you have to pay out to federal (or) (whatever)
sw4681.dff	73	A	(I) (don't) (know)
sw4681.dff	73	A	(Who) (knows) (but)
sw4681.dff	74	B	I'm not
sw4681.dff	74	B	(I) (don't) (know) I can't think of any easy answers to it but something has to happen
sw4681.dff	76	B	I'm certainly fed up with it
sw4681.dff	77	A	Everybody is in fact I'm not sending in my check
sw4682.dff	1	A	Have you had that experience recently
sw4682.dff	2	B	I can't really say recently
sw4682.dff	2	B	But (I) (think) about a year ago I bought a product from some company down in Atlanta Georgia
sw4682.dff	2	B	(I) (believe) it was one of these mixers
sw4682.dff	2	B	like these juice machines and
sw4682.dff	4	B	the blade they sent me at first that went into the machine it looked perfectly okay but I found that it was made of some material which actually ended up rusting
sw4682.dff	6	B	after even despite diligent washing it got rusty after about three weeks of use
sw4682.dff	6	B	And I don't think it was my fault because (you) (know) I had made a point of drying it off and cleaning it but (it) (was) I had to send it back after the third week because I realized (like) (it) (was) (not) something was very very wrong with the blade
sw4682.dff	6	B	what about you
sw4682.dff	7	A	I don't have so much trouble with products as service
sw4682.dff	9	A	I don't feel like that's as big a problem
sw4682.dff	9	A	I've had a few answering machines over the last two years just because I've had a lot of trouble with them working correctly
sw4682.dff	11	A	And I'm not convinced that any of them work a hundred percent
sw4682.dff	13	A	the one I have now is okay most of the time
sw4682.dff	15	A	But that's it
sw4682.dff	15	A	But that's probably the worst
sw4682.dff	15	A	My daughter has a charm bracelet I bought her that's guaranteed
sw4682.dff	15	A	James Avery
sw4682.dff	15	A	I don't know if you have that up there but it's a very good company
sw4682.dff	15	A	That
sw4682.dff	17	A	sells sterling silver things and
sw4682.dff	19	A	she has a charm bracelet with lots of charms on it a lot of money into it by now
sw4682.dff	21	A	and the catch broke and she was sitting in school on a carpet and when she stood up it caught and broke and we took it back and they said this was just obviously yanked
sw4682.dff	23	A	(This) (was) (yanked)
sw4682.dff	23	A	they were so rude about it
sw4682.dff	25	A	And so we wanted a different kind of catch and she said it's not guaranteed
sw4682.dff	25	A	And I said put it on because apparently nothing's guaranteed so do it anyway
sw4682.dff	27	A	So we got the kind we wanted and I was really disappointed with that
sw4682.dff	27	A	I felt that this was a company that should have been more reliable
sw4682.dff	29	A	and I happened to need a birthday present for one of her friends and I called there to see if they had it and the lady was very nice
sw4682.dff	29	A	(And) (I) (said) (my) (goodness) (I) (said) (you've) (been) (very) (nice) (what's) (your) (name)
sw4682.dff	29	A	(And) (she) (told) (me) (and) I said I really appreciate it
sw4682.dff	29	A	I said there seems to be a big attitude problem in that
sw4682.dff	31	A	store and it turned out she was the assistant manager (so)
sw4682.dff	32	B	at least your talking to somebody who counts
sw4682.dff	33	A	So I felt kind of good about that I didn't
sw4682.dff	35	A	even know the person's name that had given me the hard time or anything
sw4682.dff	37	A	but I just felt (like) at least I did something
sw4682.dff	37	A	Maybe they'll fix it
sw4682.dff	37	A	They might work on that
sw4682.dff	39	A	But I find attitudes are more of a problem
sw4682.dff	39	A	Service is more of a problem
sw4682.dff	40	B	(I) (find) (up) (here) (in) (the) (northeast) well we have these mail order companies like L L Bean and they are famous for (I) (guess) having really top-notch service
sw4682.dff	40	B	(They've) (got)
sw4682.dff	41	A	(Really)
sw4682.dff	42	B	I have friends and family who order from them because you can I've heard stories where you can literally buy something from them one year wear it for a year and a half (and) (even) (after) (like) (eighteen) (months) of reasonably satisfactory use they will accept it in any condition and they will gladly no questions asked take it back if for some bizarre reason you decide you don't want it anymore
sw4682.dff	42	B	(they'll) (actually) (do) (things) (like) (this)
sw4682.dff	42	B	they bend over backwards service wise for you
sw4682.dff	42	B	(I've)
sw4682.dff	43	A	(That's) (really) (great)
sw4682.dff	44	B	I've found also a lot of companies nowadays (have) they have eight hundred numbers you can call
sw4682.dff	44	B	(I) (guess) (if) (you) (call) (any) (eight) (hundred) (number) (if) (you) (can) (call) (up) (any) (eight) (hundred) (number) (directory) (assistance) (and) (you) (can) (get) (the) (eight) (hundred) (number) (of) (the) (customer) (service) (support) (line) (for) (a) (number) (of) (companies)
sw4682.dff	44	B	(And) I've tried that with a few companies lately
sw4682.dff	44	B	(And) (they've) most of them have been pretty good (but) (I) (I) (was) (one) (reason) (why) (I) (I) (buy) (a) (lot) (of) (clothing) (through) (mail) (order) (is) (that) if you buy through Bean or though (I) (guess) (Bean's) one of Bean's big competitors (is) (Land's) (End) (out) (in) I guess it's Wisconsin somewhere
sw4682.dff	44	B	(they) (are) (they're) (very) (good) (about)
sw4682.dff	46	B	(insur-) (the) (customer) (is) (always) (and) (no) (matter) (how) (crabby) (you) (might) (be) (over) (the) (phone) they are very understanding and they (ma-) make sure things are set properly if you're any way dissatisfied with their merchandise
sw4682.dff	47	A	That's really good
sw4682.dff	47	A	It use to be like that
sw4682.dff	49	A	But
sw4682.dff	51	A	I don't think most places are like that anymore
sw4682.dff	52	B	nowadays with the economy the way it is (I) (guess) there was a story on the news tonight about how because a lot of companies (are) (things) are getting rough out there there's a lot of the morale among employees tends to go down (and) (that) (in) (turn)
sw4688.dff	5	A	Just to see whether or not we're (you) (know) getting ahead falling behind or staying even (or) (what)
sw4688.dff	7	A	that's really about the extent of the kind of financial score keeping that we're doing
sw4688.dff	10	B	it's kind of difficult for me
sw4688.dff	10	B	Because now like most teachers I'm laid off and
sw4688.dff	11	A	(dear) (that's) (terrible)
sw4688.dff	12	B	so (I) (spend) (most) I substitute a lot
sw4688.dff	14	B	So it's very hard on a nonfixed income because I don't know how many days I'm going to be called in and whether I am or not to try to keep track of finances
sw4688.dff	16	B	but I know how much I have to bring in a month
sw4688.dff	16	B	And that's about it
sw4688.dff	16	B	That's about as far as we go
sw4688.dff	16	B	And then anything extra is (more) (or) (less) split up between all of us
sw4688.dff	18	B	And just thrown in the kitty (more) (or) (less) for a rainy day
sw4688.dff	19	A	(I) (see)
sw4688.dff	19	A	are you married
sw4688.dff	19	A	Are you living with people that you're sharing expenses
sw4688.dff	20	B	no
sw4688.dff	20	B	I'm a single mother
sw4688.dff	20	B	I have three children
sw4688.dff	21	A	(I) (see)
sw4688.dff	22	B	So now we get you know aid from the state at this point because there's no other way to do it
sw4688.dff	22	B	And my ex-husband just sort of took off and doesn't pay child support
sw4688.dff	23	A	(dear)
sw4688.dff	24	B	(So) (now) I know what I'm getting from the state and I have to balance (more) (or) (less) what I get from the state with my bills and try to work as many days as possible
sw4688.dff	26	B	Any time they call me in
sw4688.dff	26	B	But I still have to figure out
sw4688.dff	26	B	If I work too many days then I lose all my state aid and if I don't work enough days then I don't get enough to meet the bills and it's like a juggling act every single month
sw4688.dff	28	B	this week I've been just holding my breath and hoping they'll call me in but they probably won't because next week the kids have school vacation
sw4688.dff	29	A	(I) (see)
sw4688.dff	30	B	So (the) (four) (days) (before) they only have a four day week
sw4688.dff	32	B	and they usually don't need subs because everybody's pretty good about coming in
sw4688.dff	33	A	(I) (see)
sw4688.dff	34	B	They don't like to be absent before a vacation
sw4688.dff	35	A	(sure)
sw4688.dff	36	B	But (well) I'm shopping around as far as trying that's why I'm doing this to get some extra money
sw4688.dff	38	B	And getting pledge sheets for the Boy Scouts
sw4688.dff	38	B	My kids are in Boy Scouts so (trying) (to) (get) (pledge) (sheets) (for) (the) (Boy) (Scouts) (because) every penny I bring in is ten percent to me
sw4688.dff	38	B	So it's sort of helps defray the costs a little bit
sw4688.dff	38	B	But we do a lot of robbing Peter to pay Paul
sw4688.dff	38	B	I guess we're in the situation that a lot of middle-class Americans are in
sw4688.dff	39	A	(you're) (the) (first) my next door neighbor just lost his job
sw4688.dff	40	B	(my) (Lord)
sw4688.dff	41	A	(In) (you) (know) (one) (of) (these) his company (I) (mean) went bankrupt
sw4688.dff	41	A	it was a subsidiary of an outfit called U S Shoe or something
sw4688.dff	41	A	it was a computer subsidiary
sw4688.dff	41	A	I don't know what a shoe company's doing running a computer company
sw4688.dff	42	B	(Really)
sw4688.dff	43	A	But they just folded it up (and) (told) (him) (to) they took the top management and gave them jobs
sw4688.dff	45	A	at the corporate front office and everybody else was sent packing
sw4688.dff	47	A	(hang) (on) (one) (second) (I've) (got)
sw4688.dff	48	B	(Sure)
sw4688.dff	49	A	(somebody) (was) (knocking) (on) (my) (door) (here)
sw4688.dff	49	A	(it) (sounds) (like) (in) (a) (certain) (sense) (at) (least) (at) (the) (present) it sounds terrible to say (but) (at) (the) (present) (stage) you probably are even more in the market for a budgetary thing than most people probably might be
sw4688.dff	51	A	In terms of keeping score of input and output
sw4688.dff	52	B	(Definitely)
sw4688.dff	53	A	do you have a computer at home (or)
sw4688.dff	54	B	yes we do
sw4688.dff	54	B	And we try
sw4688.dff	56	B	to I keep track of every penny
sw4688.dff	58	B	And more or less enter it in
sw4688.dff	58	B	Every single day I'm at the computer
sw4688.dff	59	A	(I) (see)
sw4688.dff	60	B	And (it's) (like) what do we have left
sw4688.dff	62	B	what do we have to pay what
sw4688.dff	64	B	have we paid this month
sw4688.dff	64	B	What hasn't come in yet
sw4688.dff	65	A	do you use a standard spread sheet (or)
sw4691.dff	14	A	(to) (see) (what) (happens) (now) (you)
sw4691.dff	15	B	I've been to a few games before
sw4691.dff	17	B	Now you're from Texas
sw4691.dff	19	B	So you've got two football teams down there
sw4691.dff	20	A	it depends on where you're from in Texas
sw4691.dff	20	A	I live by Dallas
sw4691.dff	22	A	so we have one football team
sw4691.dff	23	B	(I) (see)
sw4691.dff	24	A	as far as we're concerned
sw4691.dff	24	A	That's how it is
sw4691.dff	25	B	There's that type of segregation
sw4691.dff	26	A	(It's) (divided)
sw4691.dff	27	B	(Wow)
sw4691.dff	28	A	(It) (really) (is) so we've got our Cowboys here (and)
sw4691.dff	30	A	and I don't think anybody roots differently (but)
sw4691.dff	31	B	(Do) (you)
sw4691.dff	32	A	I have a boyfriend that lives in Fresno and he is for the (Raiders)
sw4691.dff	34	A	L A Raiders (so)
sw4691.dff	35	B	Do you follow professional sports at all
sw4691.dff	36	A	I just started to this year because of these silly Raiders that didn't do very well
sw4691.dff	38	A	but I've been trying more this year
sw4691.dff	38	A	I think I know a little more than I use to
sw4691.dff	40	A	I never knew very much at all so I'm trying
sw4691.dff	41	B	it's a good past time
sw4691.dff	43	B	Particularly football
sw4691.dff	43	B	(They) (say) football attracts more men because of the physical aggression on the field and supposedly psychologists say that men take out their frustrations by watching football and they get together with a bunch of guys and they have a good time (and) (everything) and that's suppose to be some of the male bonding and (the) the male instincts (I) (guess) (or) (something) (about) (the)
sw4691.dff	44	A	So I shouldn't even try to do it
sw4691.dff	45	B	no
sw4691.dff	45	B	it's good in terms of a contest
sw4691.dff	46	A	(Yes)
sw4691.dff	47	B	(I) (think) (that) I personally like hockey better because it's a contact sport
sw4691.dff	47	B	It has the speed
sw4691.dff	49	B	And the hand eye coordination and it takes a certain skill to play hockey
sw4691.dff	49	B	Not everybody can play hockey
sw4691.dff	51	B	(So) (we) (and) (that's) we're a big hockey area up here I bet up here in New England as well
sw4691.dff	52	A	(Really)
sw4691.dff	53	B	as in the Minnesota area (but)
sw4691.dff	54	A	I don't even think we have that in Texas
sw4691.dff	55	B	What hockey
sw4691.dff	56	A	We might
sw4691.dff	56	A	Do we
sw4691.dff	58	A	no you probably know I don't know
sw4691.dff	59	B	No there's no hockey (there's) (no)
sw4691.dff	60	A	Nobody talks about it so I don't think we do
sw4691.dff	61	B	There's no professional hockey teams in Texas
sw4691.dff	62	A	(No) And we have a soccer team that comes and goes
sw4691.dff	62	A	We don't even have that very much (so)
sw4691.dff	63	B	I think though that professional football
sw4691.dff	65	B	in particular is becoming so diluted now
sw4691.dff	65	B	they have this World Football League
sw4691.dff	65	B	You see we have the N F L that Dallas
sw4691.dff	67	B	and Houston are in and New England Patriots and L A Raiders and those teams
sw4691.dff	67	B	There are those teams that play in professional National Football League but now they have what's called the World Football League and they have all these teams (from) there's a team in London (and) (there's) (a) (team)
sw4691.dff	69	B	there's other European teams and there's teams in the United States (an-) and they're playing now during the summer months and it's really overkill
sw4691.dff	71	B	And there's only so much football you can watch
sw4691.dff	72	A	(I) (like) (to) (do) I don't like to watch
sw4691.dff	73	B	(that's) (good)
sw4691.dff	74	A	I don't like to watch anything
sw4691.dff	74	A	So it kind of annoys me when people just lay in front of a T V and watch all this stuff
sw4691.dff	74	A	I think it's an
sw4691.dff	76	A	excuse to do nothing and I can see what you're saying about the male bonding and the
sw4691.dff	78	A	guys get together and that's kind of cool
sw4691.dff	78	A	That's fun
sw4691.dff	80	A	But it can get really overdone
sw4691.dff	81	B	have you ever been to a professional football game
sw4691.dff	82	A	(I) (have)
sw4691.dff	83	B	(Have) (you)
sw4691.dff	84	A	(I) (have)
sw4691.dff	85	B	Did you do the whole thing the tailgate party (and) (the) (whole)
sw4691.dff	86	A	(no) (no)
sw4691.dff	87	B	that's what you got to do (we) (talked) (our)
sw4691.dff	88	A	I've done that for college football
sw4691.dff	91	B	(You) (the) the same thing
sw4691.dff	93	B	we talked our wives there's about six or eight guys that we use to go out for these games
sw4691.dff	93	B	And we talked our wives into going with us one time and they had a real good time and it was basically for the social atmosphere
sw4691.dff	94	A	(And) (that's) (the) (thing)
sw4691.dff	95	B	You go three or four hours before the game
sw4691.dff	95	B	(You) (go) (set) (up)
sw4691.dff	95	B	We set a table up we do some cooking some barbecueing have a few drinks
sw4691.dff	97	B	and then go in and see the game and see the Patriots lose and then go home and eat drink some more
sw4691.dff	99	B	but that whole it's not so much the contest itself and the game itself but it's the whole atmosphere of playing of going to a game
sw4691.dff	101	B	(I-) that you miss sitting home in your parlor with a six pack of beer and some potato chips
sw4691.dff	102	A	(That's)
sw4691.dff	103	B	you miss that
sw4691.dff	104	A	(that's)
sw4691.dff	105	B	and any professional sport I think
sw4691.dff	107	B	you miss that
sw4691.dff	109	B	The atmosphere of being there
sw4691.dff	110	A	in high school I went to every football game and
sw4691.dff	112	A	I twirled
sw4691.dff	114	A	And you know (I) (didn't) I still don't know that much about football obviously
sw4691.dff	114	A	But I still had a good time
sw4691.dff	115	B	(Well) (foot-)
sw4697.dff	24	B	And usually it is the defendant (I) (guess) that wants to have the jury hear the case
sw4697.dff	25	A	(Sure)
sw4697.dff	26	B	So I'm not out for streamlining things to the point where we
sw4697.dff	28	B	take that that would require a change in the Bill of Rights I believe (and) (so)
sw4697.dff	29	A	(yes) (and) (I) (didn't) (mean) (that)
sw4697.dff	30	B	(okay)
sw4697.dff	31	A	I didn't mean that no
sw4697.dff	31	A	Because (gee) (whiz) if I didn't have (that) (not) (to) (have) a jury (that) yes I would feel (you're) that my civil rights had been violated
sw4697.dff	31	A	But I meant for some when both parties agreed that yes we're going to have a judge here
sw4697.dff	31	A	We're not going to have a jury let's get it over with
sw4697.dff	31	A	Sort of like car accidents
sw4697.dff	32	B	I think that's all ready possible
sw4697.dff	34	B	I think
sw4697.dff	36	B	that you can waive (the) (to) a
sw4697.dff	38	B	jury trial
sw4697.dff	40	B	(so)
sw4697.dff	40	B	(I) (agree) (that) that should be encouraged
sw4697.dff	42	B	People should know that that's an option just in case they feel they have to have a jury trial
sw4697.dff	42	B	But (I) (think) most lawyers do a (pretty) good job of making that evident to clients unless they feel they can tweak a jury into
sw4697.dff	43	A	Giving a different sentence
sw4697.dff	44	B	(giving) (a) (different) (sentence) or possibly if it's a civil case giving higher awards of money (or) (something)
sw4697.dff	46	B	since usually the lawyers get a percentage of the award
sw4697.dff	47	A	The take
sw4697.dff	48	B	And I suspect (it) in cases like (I) (guess) we were supposed to be doing criminals though rather than civil
sw4697.dff	48	B	(Is) (that)
sw4697.dff	49	A	we're at liberty to talk and meander as long as it's all on the same theme
sw4697.dff	52	B	(in) (the) (case) (of)
sw4697.dff	54	B	(civil) (things) (I) (think) (maybe) (the) (use) (of) (the) (jury) is (very)
sw4697.dff	56	B	often to the lawyer's advantage and (I) (think) that may be where jury use is overdone
sw4697.dff	58	B	there are cases where they could be settled
sw4697.dff	60	B	maybe
sw4697.dff	62	B	out of court a little more efficiently
sw4697.dff	64	B	But the lawyers are really it's to their advantage to play to as big an audience
sw4697.dff	66	B	as possible
sw4697.dff	68	B	so
sw4697.dff	68	B	I was wondering too if they were thinking about the judge making awards in civil cases
sw4697.dff	70	B	not just sentencing in a criminal cases
sw4697.dff	72	B	I'm not so sure I'm in favor of that
sw4697.dff	72	B	But I am in favor of it for criminal cases so there's a difference of my view there for those two
sw4697.dff	73	A	(bu-) you can tell I haven't been in too many judges chambers (or) (anything) (like) (that)
sw4697.dff	74	B	Have you ever had to serve jury duty
sw4697.dff	75	A	(N-) I was called once when I was nineteen
sw4697.dff	77	A	but I was doing so many other things that they took pity on me and I was doing school and things like they let me out
sw4697.dff	79	A	(An-) I've never had to it since and that was almost twenty years ago
sw4697.dff	80	B	(It) (isn't) sort of amazed me they first caught up with me for the first time
sw4697.dff	82	B	in that would have been about twenty years too
sw4697.dff	84	B	just last year and the case I heard was a criminal case and it seemed it really
sw4697.dff	86	B	trivial
sw4697.dff	86	B	It involved two bicycles
sw4697.dff	88	B	We didn't do the sentencing
sw4697.dff	88	B	The judge did
sw4697.dff	91	A	(How) (interesting)
sw4697.dff	92	B	we rendered a verdict and then the judge was the one to do the sentencing
sw4697.dff	94	B	And that was here in Wisconsin
sw4697.dff	94	B	So I don't know if that varies from state to state (or) (if) (it)
sw4698.dff	1	A	I've been involved in electronics a long time
sw4698.dff	1	A	in computers and I have really resisted the impulse to get one for the home
sw4698.dff	3	A	up until (I) (guess) maybe about a year and a half ago I got one for my son
sw4698.dff	3	A	a Macintosh
sw4698.dff	5	A	L C
sw4698.dff	5	A	It's a real easy to use color computer and I got a very nice printer that goes along with it and he uses it for his school work
sw4698.dff	6	B	I'm currently in school so I've had an I B M clone (I) (guess) for a couple of years now which I've been (trying) continually upgrading (I) (guess)
sw4698.dff	6	B	And I've found that I pretty much become addicted to it and (I) (can't) (really) I've found that most of homework assignments really require some sort of computer simulation or analysis so
sw4698.dff	8	B	it's very essential for me
sw4698.dff	8	B	Schools have them but lot of times so difficult to get on them at school
sw4698.dff	8	B	it's much more convenient to have one at home
sw4698.dff	9	A	Where you going to school
sw4698.dff	10	B	At Georgia Tech
sw4698.dff	11	A	(I) (see)
sw4698.dff	12	B	(so)
sw4698.dff	13	A	In engineering
sw4698.dff	14	B	Yes actually
sw4698.dff	15	A	So that explains all the computer assignments
sw4698.dff	16	B	(it)
sw4698.dff	17	A	do you use your P C for things other than explicit computer work
sw4698.dff	18	B	sure
sw4698.dff	18	B	I have some games of course which I play on there and I have a program which allows me to access a weather data bank so I can check up on the weather around the country or whatever which is a hobby
sw4698.dff	18	B	So it provides (other) means other than just strict computations and so on so
sw4698.dff	18	B	do you have a computer for yourself at home
sw4698.dff	19	A	No
sw4698.dff	19	A	(No) I just have one for my son and I really sort of have the feeling that word processing is a big market for
sw4698.dff	21	A	home computing
sw4698.dff	22	B	(Tha-)
sw4698.dff	23	A	at work I'm a technologist and I in the past have done a great deal of system development (just) through software development programming
sw4698.dff	23	A	but now I find myself using the computer even the computer at work is primarily a word processing system
sw4698.dff	25	A	and a communication system
sw4698.dff	26	B	Do you use Email and like that
sw4698.dff	27	A	Yes
sw4698.dff	27	A	Emil probably pulls down a third of all my time
sw4698.dff	28	B	(It's) I have modem night computer so I can log into the network at Georgia Tech and access my account through there which can be useful
sw4698.dff	28	B	But that and word processing is while (I) (tend) (to) (obviously) I do almost all of my report writing on my computer whether it's term papers or even some smaller homework assignments
sw4698.dff	30	B	So it's (I) (don't) (know) really become my mainstay (I) (guess)
sw4698.dff	30	B	(I) (can't) (even) (remember) I don't think I've ever used a typewriter in my life to do a report
sw4698.dff	30	B	Because my family when I was growing up we got a basic computer
sw4698.dff	30	B	T R S Eighty when they first came out
sw4698.dff	32	B	And I even used that to do my first reports when I was in junior high (so)
sw4698.dff	33	A	I'm a old-timer
sw4698.dff	33	A	I did my Master's thesis on a typewriter
sw4698.dff	35	A	I rented an I B M Selectric
sw4698.dff	37	A	And it was a pretty big deal
sw4698.dff	38	B	(It) (must) (have) (been) (tough)
sw4698.dff	38	B	It's a little bit strange for me
sw4698.dff	38	B	I did my Master's thesis last year and I did that on a computer and (it) (seems) (like) I (just) can't imagine how people did it before
sw4698.dff	38	B	It must have been just so much work
sw4698.dff	39	A	it was (just) a completely different world then
sw4698.dff	40	B	so you used your son's Macintosh then
sw4698.dff	40	B	do you like that kind of computer
sw4698.dff	41	A	I like it (I) (like) (it) from a distance really
sw4698.dff	41	A	I see the packages on it that are available and it's nice
sw4698.dff	41	A	I (really) don't use it myself
sw4698.dff	43	A	when I come home from work I like to stay far away from
sw4698.dff	45	A	computers and electronic things
sw4698.dff	47	A	so I let my son do it and
sw4698.dff	49	A	of course there's an intellectual evolution taking place where it's sort of a joke but it's really true the old-timers even the people who are technologists don't know how to operate these electronic things like V C R -s (and) (whatnot) and the kids they just take to it like candy
sw4698.dff	50	B	if the interface is there so that it's fun to use and the challenge
sw4703.dff	1	A	(Okay)
sw4703.dff	2	B	what is your opinion on drug testing
sw4703.dff	3	A	I can see it in certain cases where somebody's in a position that perhaps a lot of lives are involved (like) maybe pilots that fly jets and (maybe) people that have a lot of responsibility over a (large) mass of people
sw4703.dff	3	A	I could certainly see it being done but in general whether companies want to do this and I know that companies do
sw4703.dff	3	A	factory workers that have lots of accidents are now being drug tested
sw4703.dff	3	A	I know a couple of corporations that are doing that
sw4703.dff	3	A	(so) they (kind) (of) have gotten into the idea that let's drug test them and let's put them through rehab
sw4703.dff	3	A	But there's got to be a limitation
sw4703.dff	3	A	Do we drug test everybody that comes in or do we (kind) (of) say well you can be drug tested and you look okay because you look this way
sw4703.dff	3	A	you're very conservative and there's just no way that we would think that you would use drugs but the guy that doesn't fit the stereotype of the conservative (or) (whatever) could be drug tested
sw4703.dff	3	A	And (whether) legal rights of that person I don't know
sw4703.dff	3	A	There's certainly a lot of things to really consider when you get into drug testing people just at the work place unless (of) (course) (like) (I) (said) they have a large responsibility over a mass of people that's about it
sw4703.dff	4	B	(it's) (just) (not) (the) (com-) you're talking about company's liability
sw4703.dff	6	B	if the company is liable for something that a employee does while under the influence of a drug (then) (by) (all) (means) (they) (should) (have) (the) (to) (to) (to) (to)
sw4703.dff	7	A	(Sure) (sure)
sw4703.dff	7	A	And I think that's what companies are doing more and more because there are products that are out there
sw4703.dff	8	B	to minimize their liability
sw4703.dff	8	B	And there's also the case about (just) (health) health and welfare of the employees
sw4703.dff	10	B	(If) (a) (company) (has) (a) (healthy) (work) (force) (their)
sw4703.dff	11	A	(Exactly)
sw4703.dff	12	B	insurance rates are low
sw4703.dff	13	A	(Sure) (sure)
sw4703.dff	14	B	And not only low there's all sorts of a financial benefits associated
sw4703.dff	15	A	(Sure)
sw4703.dff	16	B	(with) (you) (know) having people file fewer claims being sick
sw4703.dff	17	A	(Exactly)
sw4703.dff	17	A	(The) (only) (thing) (is)
sw4703.dff	18	B	there's the whole question that a work force that is known not to be on drugs is going to be more healthy (I) (don't) (think) (anybody)
sw4703.dff	19	A	(Exactly)
sw4703.dff	20	B	(would) (argue) (with) (that)
sw4703.dff	21	A	(Exactly)
sw4703.dff	21	A	The only thing is the one issue that I would take stands with is the fact that the drug testing itself can be done on a person that is actually not on drugs and come out positive
sw4703.dff	23	A	If they have had medications in the past (let's) (say) once a month or twice a month or three times a month or maybe that week they take an Advil and the Advil will (apparently) come out positive as if they smoked marijuana
sw4703.dff	25	A	and there's poppy seed (type) (things)
sw4703.dff	25	A	I think that everybody is aware of that but where's the line where you say to somebody I'm going to drug test you tomorrow so please do not take these medications or you know how (can)
sw4703.dff	26	B	(wel-) (the) (ques-)
sw4703.dff	27	A	how you can do it
sw4703.dff	28	B	The question becomes what do you do about somebody who tests positive
sw4703.dff	29	A	(Exactly)
sw4703.dff	30	B	(D-) that's where the real sticking point comes in
sw4703.dff	32	B	It's not I don't think there's any problem with testing people
sw4703.dff	33	A	(Sure)
sw4703.dff	34	B	It's what do you do with the information
sw4703.dff	35	A	(Sure)
sw4703.dff	35	A	(Exactly)
sw4703.dff	35	A	and the only thing that I would say on that is it could blacklist an employee later on
sw4703.dff	35	A	Let's say you've taken medication (of) (some) (sort) even though they usually have you at the time list what medications you've taken
sw4703.dff	35	A	let's say you do come out positive and you've taken Advil or any of the Ibuprofen products out there
sw4703.dff	35	A	Or you've had a cold and you've been on medication (or) (whatever) you come out positive
sw4703.dff	35	A	Is it then the chance that the employer will look at you in more of a negative fashion and say this is kind of iffy are they really on drugs or they on drugs (you) (know) (what) (I'm) (saying)
sw4703.dff	35	A	(Where)
sw4707.dff	1	B	(Not) (very) (good) it's not been a good day
sw4707.dff	2	A	(I) (went)
sw4707.dff	4	A	I turned mine in about twelve hours early at noon
sw4707.dff	5	B	I don't know
sw4707.dff	5	B	I finished mine up about eleven and left it here with Carolyn so I hope she's turned it in
sw4707.dff	6	A	Are you eating
sw4707.dff	7	B	(I) (ju-) (go) (ahead) I'll stop eating
sw4707.dff	7	B	(I) just barely got
sw4707.dff	8	A	(No) (it's)
sw4707.dff	9	B	home from the university
sw4707.dff	10	A	Say what
sw4707.dff	11	B	I just barely got home from the university
sw4707.dff	12	A	Tell you what we can do is I can punch the one
sw4707.dff	14	A	and then after five minutes when the voice comes on we can talk all night if we want
sw4707.dff	15	B	Okay go ahead fire away
sw4707.dff	16	A	I love the irony of talking about this subject on April the
sw4707.dff	18	A	fifteenth
sw4707.dff	18	A	But I'm afraid I'm probably in the minority
sw4707.dff	18	A	I actually don't think (that) we pay too much in this country
sw4707.dff	19	B	I agree with you
sw4707.dff	20	A	particularly in this part of the country (w-) (I) (guess) I do have a bone to pick with the way taxes are distributed
sw4707.dff	20	A	I just finished fuming at the fact that we pay an eight and a half percent sales tax and no income tax when the income tax could have been deducted from the federal form
sw4707.dff	22	A	and the sales tax can't
sw4707.dff	22	A	I think that's regressive and it's kind of dumb
sw4707.dff	23	B	I hate the eight and a half percent sales tax
sw4707.dff	23	B	But on the other hand I don't mind that it's only on things that aren't like groceries (and) (that) (it's) (not) (on) (that)
sw4707.dff	24	A	nobody taxes groceries
sw4707.dff	25	B	they do
sw4707.dff	26	A	Where
sw4707.dff	27	B	In Arizona
sw4707.dff	28	A	(Is) (that)
sw4707.dff	31	B	But we have a (I) (mean) pretty low tax rate here
sw4707.dff	31	B	I think the sales tax they just got to do something about it
sw4707.dff	33	B	But that's the politicalness of trying to not create any new taxes
sw4707.dff	34	A	But (I) (guess) when I see the comparison between the United States and any other western country their rates are forty-one forty-two and ours are thirty-six thirty-seven if you compute as a percentage of total income all taxes lumped together we actually do pretty well
sw4707.dff	34	A	there's no other country that is taxed as low as we are
sw4707.dff	35	B	and I still think that having lived in Europe for awhile difference in living conditions
sw4707.dff	37	B	are certainly well worth what we pay for it
sw4707.dff	38	A	I'm not sure I understand what you mean
sw4707.dff	39	B	(I) (think) I was in Germany for several years
sw4707.dff	41	B	and I'd a lot rather pay taxes here and have what we have then have to live there
sw4707.dff	42	A	you mean lowest end of living in spite of higher taxes
sw4707.dff	43	B	(Higher) (taxes)
sw4707.dff	44	A	I suppose that's true probably less so now than it was ten years ago (or) (whatever) (but)
sw4707.dff	45	B	Still's that way to some extent
sw4707.dff	47	B	I think the other problem is it's easy to complain about taxes because there's something you theoretically can do something about
sw4707.dff	49	B	But I look for example and you're not quite in the same situation but school taxes for me
sw4707.dff	51	B	biggest bargain in the world
sw4707.dff	51	B	I wish I didn't have to pay any more to my physicians in a year
sw4707.dff	53	B	than I had to pay for all of my school taxes
sw4707.dff	54	A	since I send my kids to parochial school (that)
sw4707.dff	55	B	(that's) (probably) (a) (little) (tougher) (on) (you)
sw4707.dff	56	A	it's not quite the bargain (that)
sw4707.dff	58	A	But I pay them gladly
sw4707.dff	58	A	That's a decision I think it's a dumb decision on our part because countries like Canada and England and Germany do perfectly well with a two tract system in which religious schools coexist with secular schools with the same tax money
sw4707.dff	58	A	But that's the way Americans want to interpret it (I) (guess) (that's) (all) (But) (I)
sw4707.dff	60	A	and if I were when I was single and again when I'm retired
sw4707.dff	62	A	I will not mind paying what it takes to keep the schools good
sw4707.dff	62	A	That's always been a high priority
sw4707.dff	63	B	No I think that's just you though
sw4707.dff	64	A	(I) (do) (that's) (true)
sw4707.dff	64	A	I think in places
sw4707.dff	66	A	I think in places like California people are beginning to find that in in areas that are fairly well off if you add the people of various sexual persuasions and those who never intend to marry and those who are retired and those are just looking for fun (th-) people with families turn out to be such a small minority that they can't get a tax bill passed no matter what happens
sw4707.dff	68	A	And
sw4707.dff	70	A	there are big sections of the country where people with children of school age are such a small minority that they can't get anything done
sw4707.dff	70	A	That seems like a cultural lapse
sw4707.dff	70	A	people always used to be willing to ante up for the schools
sw4707.dff	70	A	(They)
sw4709.dff	1	A	Okay
sw4709.dff	1	A	What would you rather have
sw4709.dff	1	A	Or you want salary too plus what
sw4709.dff	1	A	What's most important to you
sw4709.dff	2	B	as far as tangible benefits go I would say that health insurance of all forms is probably my next most important concern
sw4709.dff	4	B	I feel that a company that can provide good health benefits such as health care dental and vision
sw4709.dff	6	B	as well as good long-term and short-term disability plans goes a long way toward satisfying my needs
sw4709.dff	7	A	(I'll) (tell) (you)
sw4709.dff	7	A	I think that is the most important thing
sw4709.dff	7	A	I'm not working at the moment but the company that I did work for (excuse) (me) I had health benefits
sw4709.dff	7	A	dental vision all that pension plan now I don't have that although I do have a pension that I'm drawing from them which (thank) (God) I had
sw4709.dff	9	A	(But) (man) I think those medical benefits are the most important
sw4709.dff	10	B	you really don't realize how important they are until you find yourself on the other side of the fence without them and having to cover your own medical and you can quickly see where they become a very important part of your compensation package
sw4709.dff	11	A	(I) (should) (knock) (on) (wood)
sw4709.dff	11	A	I haven't had any serious health problems or anything
sw4709.dff	11	A	I've only probably been to the doctor a couple of times since I left work and it was only for a cold and they can't really do anything for you anyhow so you might as well not even go
sw4709.dff	12	B	they look at you say you're still breathing (so)
sw4709.dff	13	A	you've got a cold
sw4709.dff	13	A	Go home and take liquids and rest
sw4709.dff	15	A	But
sw4709.dff	17	A	that is definitely the most important
sw4709.dff	17	A	pension I guess is next
sw4709.dff	17	A	thank God that I had one
sw4709.dff	17	A	I don't know what happened to the salary employees when the company went bankrupt but I was union so mine was being put into (like) a trust fund
sw4709.dff	19	A	but I don't know if they ever got anything or if they lost all of theirs (or)
sw4709.dff	20	B	I suspect that it just disappeared
sw4709.dff	21	A	that's what I was thinking too
sw4709.dff	21	A	I really feel sorry for all those people that spent all that time there
sw4709.dff	23	A	So what company do you work for
sw4709.dff	24	B	I work for a little start-up company here in Pittsburgh called Trans Ark
sw4709.dff	26	B	Have you heard of them
sw4709.dff	27	A	(No)
sw4709.dff	28	B	we do distributive system software
sw4709.dff	30	B	for Unix based workstations
sw4709.dff	32	B	(So)
sw4709.dff	33	A	No I worked for a trucking company P I E nation wide
sw4709.dff	33	A	You probably heard of that
sw4709.dff	34	B	yes (yes)
sw4709.dff	34	B	In fact my mom drives trucks (so)
sw4709.dff	35	A	does she really
sw4709.dff	36	B	Yes
sw4709.dff	37	A	(how) (about) (that)
sw4709.dff	38	B	So after the merger you see a lot of Ryder PIE stuff on the road
sw4709.dff	39	A	(you) (did)
sw4709.dff	40	B	So did Ryder get out of the business
sw4709.dff	40	B	(Is) (that) (what) (happened) (or)
sw4709.dff	41	A	Ryder and P I E went together
sw4709.dff	43	A	and then (then) that ended it
sw4709.dff	44	B	So that the merger pretty much ended the whole thing
sw4709.dff	45	A	(It) (really) (did)
sw4709.dff	45	A	it started (I) (think) a little bit before that but when P I E and Ryder went together (why) that was downhill from then on
sw4709.dff	46	B	and the problem with that is when you leave a job you can continue your benefits for some finite period of time
sw4709.dff	48	B	But when the company goes bankrupt they're just cut off completely and you're responsible for your own
sw4709.dff	50	B	and that's exceedingly expensive
sw4709.dff	51	A	(Yes) it was over three hundred fifty dollars a month if we wanted to continue our own benefits
sw4709.dff	51	A	We could do that for eighteen months
sw4709.dff	53	A	But three hundred and fifty dollars a month
sw4709.dff	53	A	(God) (that's) (terrible)
sw4709.dff	54	B	(It's) (definitely) (excessive)
sw4709.dff	55	A	anyhow (and) jobs aren't that hard to find to get another one that does pay your benefits
sw4709.dff	56	B	(True)
sw4709.dff	57	A	And a lot of them if you do get a job they don't pay benefits
sw4709.dff	58	B	they're starting to cut back
sw4709.dff	58	B	Especially start-ups
sw4709.dff	58	B	I know here at Trans Ark we get health care and that's it
sw4709.dff	60	B	there's no dental or vision
sw4709.dff	62	B	And the short-term disability policy is a ninety day policy and there is no long-term disability policy
sw4709.dff	64	B	So at least in the case of this particular company they tend to scrimp a little bit there
sw4709.dff	66	B	And of course they can use the excuse we're start-up
sw4709.dff	67	A	But what's happening is the disability plan so many people are lying about their things
sw4709.dff	67	A	(God) there's been big articles in the paper about that
sw4709.dff	67	A	they claim a back injury and then someone goes out and spies on them and they're lifting refrigerators into trucks and
sw4709.dff	69	A	and everything else So I don't know what's happening and what's going to happen
sw4709.dff	69	A	(But)
sw4716.dff	1	A	(Okay)
sw4716.dff	1	A	(I) (guess) if I had to rate it from one to ten (I) (guess)
sw4716.dff	3	A	I would rate it a five in the aspect that I wouldn't want everybody to have guns and I think there should be limitations of semiautomatics
sw4716.dff	3	A	(things) (like) that should not be just given out to anybody
sw4716.dff	3	A	In fact I can't imagine anybody having a semiautomatic for what purpose
sw4716.dff	5	A	so (I) (guess) being that I come from a hunting family
sw4716.dff	7	A	I'd rather have some restrictions put on weapons but yet allow hunting rifles things that people would use for sporting type of a activity
sw4716.dff	7	A	Those would be fine but when you get into a lot of the more complex weapons I would say yes we need to put restrictions on them
sw4716.dff	8	B	I probably would have to agree with you pretty much all the way I think
sw4716.dff	10	B	I definitely think that some things shouldn't be limited like you said rifles and
sw4716.dff	12	B	hunting rifles and possible handguns for people who use them to
sw4716.dff	13	A	(Exactly) (for) (self-protection) (sure)
sw4716.dff	14	B	but I think semiautomatic weapons people say they use them for sport
sw4716.dff	14	B	But I personally cannot see any use for them
sw4716.dff	15	A	(I) (can't) (imagine) (that)
sw4716.dff	16	B	other than for people who dislike have some sort of crazed
sw4716.dff	18	B	ambition to have high powered weapons or something
sw4716.dff	19	A	To do massive amounts of killing
sw4716.dff	20	B	(And)
sw4716.dff	22	B	(how) (much) (do) (you) (wa-)
sw4716.dff	23	A	The only thing that I can see is the police having it in a case where somebody is going to kill a massive amount of people or somebody that's escaping that's very dangerous
sw4716.dff	25	A	semiautomatic would allow more rounds to be put out to hopefully catch the person and get him down
sw4716.dff	27	A	But I think of my family
sw4716.dff	27	A	they're very much into sporting (you) (know) as far as hunting and also clay pigeons
sw4716.dff	29	A	things like that
sw4716.dff	31	A	So they may have some shotguns
sw4716.dff	31	A	They may have other type of hunting type things but I figured if the criminals had to take a hunting gun out to kill somebody more than likely somebody would see it you know what I'm saying
sw4716.dff	33	A	versus you know a small handgun
sw4716.dff	34	B	(that's) (true)
sw4716.dff	35	A	that can be put in your coat pocket and nobody would see it
sw4716.dff	37	A	but yet you can't stop people from having a handgun in their home
sw4716.dff	39	A	Even if there are small children around (there's)
sw4716.dff	41	A	you can't say people with small children can't have guns
sw4716.dff	43	A	and people without small children that may have grandchildren
sw4716.dff	45	A	still have these guns but
sw4716.dff	47	A	I guess I was always taught
sw4716.dff	49	A	number one a gun isn't a toy
sw4716.dff	51	A	and I don't know if that makes a difference if the parent sets down to them and say this gun can kill you
sw4716.dff	53	A	and don't ever play with it
sw4716.dff	55	A	(so) (I) (don't) (know) (if) (that) (makes) (a) (difference) (or) (what) (but)
sw4716.dff	56	B	I think if you're to say okay we have to get rid of them all because
sw4716.dff	58	B	they only seem to do bad (it's) (saying) (we're) (t-)
sw4716.dff	59	A	The criminals would get them
sw4716.dff	59	A	even if they had to go across border to get them
sw4716.dff	60	B	And people who have them and are responsible with them (are) are being punished (and) (people) (who)
sw4716.dff	62	B	and they're saying that people you cannot take care of things yourself or that you're not smart enough to teach your kids (how) (to) (how) (to)
sw4716.dff	63	A	How (you) (know) to make sure the guns are put up as something as
sw4716.dff	65	A	not a toy
sw4716.dff	67	A	Because we had guns all over our house when we were kids
sw4716.dff	69	A	and not that they were laying on the couch or anything like that
sw4716.dff	71	A	but I never had an interest in them
sw4716.dff	73	A	(being) (in) the fact that I knew that guns could kill
sw4716.dff	75	A	and I had four brothers and never messed with any type of guns
sw4716.dff	77	A	(and) (so) (it) (was) (kind) (of) (the) (idea) (that) (we) (knew) (that) (a) (gun) (could) (kill) (and) (that) (a) (gun) (wasn't) (a) (toy)
sw4716.dff	79	A	(and) of course we were quite young and we went through
sw4716.dff	81	A	the National Rifle Club
sw4716.dff	83	A	and so we were taught (kind) (of) at a good age ten and eleven and twelve to sit down with a kid and say okay if you're going to learn how to shoot a gun you're going to learn how to do it correctly and you're going to learn how to have safeguards (and)
sw4716.dff	85	A	and know how to protect yourself but yet have this
sw4716.dff	87	A	training so that kids aren't they have to have a certain respect for it
sw4716.dff	88	B	I mean I grew up in a family and my father had two guns
sw4716.dff	90	B	because he used to hunt years ago (but)
sw4716.dff	91	A	(Sure)
sw4716.dff	92	B	he stopped really before I was old enough to remember
sw4716.dff	94	B	and I knew we had the guns in the house and the time my father was keeping them just for protection at the time
sw4716.dff	95	A	(Sure)
sw4716.dff	96	B	but I mean none of us ever thought let's go look at the gun or let's go get the gun it was just something you knew was there
sw4716.dff	97	A	(Yes)
sw4716.dff	98	B	and it was your father's and that was not something you'd played with at all
sw4716.dff	100	B	and that's the thing that should be (stressed)
sw4720.dff	1	A	(I) (think) I'm fairly pleased with the benefits (that) we have working for a large corporation
sw4720.dff	1	A	(And) for me there's (absolutely) no question what's the most important (benefit)
sw4720.dff	3	A	(I) (think) it's health care
sw4720.dff	3	A	(It's) (what) I think everybody would say that
sw4720.dff	4	B	(and) if you try to get it outside of your corporation you're going to pay an arm and a leg
sw4720.dff	5	A	belonging to a health group is probably the most important protection you can have (after) (you)
sw4720.dff	7	A	(the) sometimes I think it's more important than salary
sw4720.dff	8	B	do you also get dental
sw4720.dff	9	A	Yes
sw4720.dff	9	A	(And) I don't know if I would rank that second but since I have three boys it can (turn) (out) (to) be important
sw4720.dff	10	B	(I) (know)
sw4720.dff	11	A	in a given year dental expenses can really kill you
sw4720.dff	12	B	my husband is with Northwest Airlines (and) he gets (the) full health and dental (and) we have four children and what you pay just to have teeth cleaned is outrageous
sw4720.dff	14	B	And I don't know how people that don't have it can afford it
sw4720.dff	15	A	(It's)
sw4720.dff	16	B	Or maybe they don't
sw4720.dff	17	A	and then if the cleaning doesn't get you the orthodony will
sw4720.dff	18	B	(That's) (That's)
sw4720.dff	19	A	I guess that would be up there
sw4720.dff	19	A	I'm not sure how I would rank that say compared to retirement or pretax savings was another thing that I think is (a)
sw4720.dff	21	A	(a) (great) a great benefit
sw4720.dff	23	A	And I think it's really something that the government ought to encourage more because there are all these complaints about how we're not a saving country
sw4720.dff	25	A	and where the average savings rate is something like four percent in this country and fifteen percent in Germany and Japan
sw4720.dff	26	B	it's a lot easier to save it when you don't get your hands on it first
sw4720.dff	27	A	when you have the economy to scale and everything that a large corporation has you can offer some incentive and if the government goes along by not taxing it when you put it aside
sw4720.dff	29	A	you can really build up the savings that you wouldn't otherwise do (and)
sw4720.dff	30	B	what about lesser benefits perhaps for you but for the women in the corporation
sw4720.dff	30	B	(For) (example)
sw4720.dff	31	A	Leave
sw4720.dff	34	B	do they have father leaves or anything like that
sw4720.dff	35	A	I don't think so yet
sw4720.dff	35	A	They may have just plain parental leave which either one can take
sw4720.dff	37	A	I know their maternity leave is on the order of six weeks which I think is too short
sw4720.dff	38	B	(I) (do) (too)
sw4720.dff	39	A	I really think that we need to get into the mold where we talk about years rather than months or weeks
sw4720.dff	40	B	I think it's just a crying shame
sw4720.dff	42	B	for a mother to have to go back to work at six weeks
sw4720.dff	43	A	(and)
sw4720.dff	44	B	She isn't recovered
sw4720.dff	44	B	And
sw4720.dff	45	A	(There)
sw4720.dff	46	B	the infant needs her desperately
sw4720.dff	48	B	at that point and time
sw4720.dff	49	A	There ought to be some compromise where the person would be guaranteed a career type position but not necessarily a continuation of exactly the same position
sw4720.dff	51	A	in exchange for a longer period of time
sw4720.dff	52	B	(I) (agree)
sw4720.dff	53	A	it's so important to families then and yet anybody who's gotten far enough to get a good salary is really reluctant to give that up
sw4720.dff	54	B	(sure)
sw4720.dff	56	B	Especially in this day and age
sw4720.dff	57	A	(That)
sw4720.dff	58	B	You don't want to start over again anywhere
sw4720.dff	59	A	(you're) I think you've put your finger on the one benefit that I would most like to see changed
sw4720.dff	59	A	the parental leave
sw4720.dff	60	B	I think they've come a long way
sw4720.dff	62	B	at least some companies
sw4720.dff	62	B	Some of them my girlfriend in particular that works for a rental car agency and as manager they have a very (very) poor leave policy and I just don't know how women do it
sw4720.dff	62	B	Particularly single parents who don't have the support at the other end
sw4720.dff	63	A	They do it by shortchanging their kids
sw4720.dff	63	A	There's no other way
sw4720.dff	64	B	(That's) (That's) (exactly)
sw4720.dff	65	A	unless they're part of some extended family which is unlikely
sw4720.dff	67	A	people moving as much
sw4720.dff	67	A	And it's just a terrible choice you shouldn't have to make it
sw4720.dff	69	A	(you're)
sw4720.dff	71	A	(And)
sw4720.dff	72	B	One of the benefits we get of course is travel
sw4720.dff	73	A	(Boy) would I like to have that
sw4720.dff	74	B	It's wonderful
sw4720.dff	76	B	The only trouble is that you can afford to go anywhere but you can't afford to stay once you get there
sw4720.dff	77	A	listen I have friends in a lot of different cities
sw4720.dff	77	A	If you just fly me there I'll take care of that
sw4720.dff	78	B	(That's) You have to have an awful lot of fun just getting there has to be half the fun
sw4720.dff	81	A	(and) (I) (guess) (the)
sw4721.dff	2	A	You want to go first
sw4721.dff	3	B	no I don't get as much exercise as I should (as) or as I would like to these days
sw4721.dff	3	B	(I) seems to be to easy to get busy with other things
sw4721.dff	3	B	I have in the past jogged and (and) run and every January and every September I start out again and then it tapers off
sw4721.dff	4	A	Really
sw4721.dff	5	B	what about you
sw4721.dff	6	A	I do a lot of exercise
sw4721.dff	6	A	now I'm into jazzercise which I absolutely love
sw4721.dff	6	A	I started about two years ago because I gained some weight over the past few years and I wanted to get it back off
sw4721.dff	8	A	and I was going through a divorce and I just found that running really made me feel good
sw4721.dff	10	A	Got out a lot of aggression
sw4721.dff	10	A	I went to the gym every day (and) I ran on the treadmill (and) rode the bike and I felt really good
sw4721.dff	10	A	I needed to do it and it was really helpful at the time
sw4721.dff	10	A	Now when I do those things they're boring
sw4721.dff	10	A	I would rather be outside then in the gym doing this in one place
sw4721.dff	12	A	And so I just recently discovered jazzercise about two months ago
sw4721.dff	12	A	And I'm getting to be a good dancer from it and I'm just feeling really good
sw4721.dff	12	A	I love the class it's real challenging so I'm really into that
sw4721.dff	14	A	(I) (really) (like) (that) (a) (lot)
sw4721.dff	15	B	that's related to the aerobic
sw4721.dff	16	A	it's aerobics but it's with dance steps
sw4721.dff	17	B	(Okay)
sw4721.dff	18	A	It's an aerobic exercise and it's an hour straight
sw4721.dff	18	A	(And) it's a lot of fun
sw4721.dff	18	A	I feel like I'm not just exercising
sw4721.dff	20	A	Because I'm dancing and I'm getting much better
sw4721.dff	20	A	My stamina is getting great for the dance floor so
sw4721.dff	22	A	(it's) (just) there's a lot of positive things with it (so)
sw4721.dff	23	B	(okay)
sw4721.dff	23	B	Now that's inside again
sw4721.dff	24	A	It is inside and I've
sw4721.dff	25	B	(But)
sw4721.dff	26	A	been doing a lot of bike riding outside with the nice weather we've been having and I just enjoy that much more too than inside
sw4721.dff	27	B	do you like to do it with other people
sw4721.dff	27	B	like the jazzercise would be
sw4721.dff	28	A	I have a thirteen year old daughter and so we go bike riding and it's nice
sw4721.dff	28	A	We get
sw4721.dff	30	A	to spend some time together rather than I go to the gym while she does her homework
sw4721.dff	32	A	So I've enjoyed that part of it
sw4721.dff	32	A	And at the gym even in the class (I) it's not really a group where you chat a lot
sw4721.dff	32	A	Everybody's on their way to someplace
sw4721.dff	34	A	(and) (so) I do
sw4721.dff	35	B	(But)
sw4721.dff	36	A	have one friend who goes occasionally but basically I do it by myself in a group of maybe forty so
sw4721.dff	37	B	But still there are other people there doing the same thing
sw4721.dff	38	A	There are (there) (are)
sw4721.dff	38	A	It's more motivating that way I think
sw4721.dff	39	B	(In) (terms) (of) (motivation) (and) (incentive)
sw4721.dff	40	A	You could get a tape probably and do it at home in front of the T V but you probably wouldn't
sw4721.dff	43	B	that makes a difference doesn't it
sw4721.dff	45	B	(I've) one thing when I have run and jogged I've always enjoyed doing it by myself and not with the sense that it was chore or something that I was having to do I've really enjoyed just the activity and I write software as far as the job and so getting out and being active helps out
sw4721.dff	45	B	(th-) (it's)
sw4721.dff	46	A	(I) (can) (see) (it'll) (be) (a) (good) (break)
sw4721.dff	47	B	the change of pace and just
sw4721.dff	49	B	getting out and around and I find that I can often (often) when I get around to doing it then I feel better when I get back to work
sw4721.dff	51	B	(and) (also) my subconscious is working on things while I'm working
sw4721.dff	53	B	and I go back and I've got new ideas (but) (still)
sw4721.dff	54	A	(I) (think) (you) (do)
sw4721.dff	54	A	You feel very good after (you) exercise
sw4721.dff	54	A	(I) (think)
sw4721.dff	56	A	it's worth making the time for yourself
sw4721.dff	56	A	You owe it to yourself
sw4721.dff	58	A	and (I) (think) you do accomplish more after that
sw4721.dff	60	A	(And) (I) (think) that it's (just) (is) good for your self-esteem for everything because when you look better you feel better and (it's) (just) I think it's well worth it
sw4721.dff	60	A	I just demand that time for myself
sw4721.dff	60	A	Now I've learned to do that
sw4721.dff	62	A	(you) (know) and I think it (just) benefits you all around
sw4721.dff	62	A	(So)
sw4721.dff	63	B	I (think) that's a good term demanding the time for yourself
sw4721.dff	63	B	(That) (you've) (just) (got) (to)
sw4721.dff	64	A	You have to
sw4721.dff	64	A	Because
sw4721.dff	65	B	(you've) (just) (got) (to) (prior-)
sw4721.dff	66	A	there's always more things to do
sw4721.dff	68	A	There is always things that you can make priority to it but I don't demand a lot for myself (and) so
sw4721.dff	70	A	I (just) feel entitled to it and I take it so
sw4721.dff	71	B	(good) (good)
sw4721.dff	71	B	have you done any jogging
sw4721.dff	71	B	(I) (tell) (you) you said you did (on) the bike and on (the) treadmill in the club
sw4721.dff	72	A	No I've done some walking with friends (in) (the) (past)
sw4721.dff	74	A	But I find that when you do that you do more chatting than you do
sw4721.dff	76	A	exercise and that's not really beneficial so
sw4721.dff	78	A	I don't have time like that and I spend enough time chatting (around) (everywhere)
sw4723.dff	49	A	There's some that are prettier than others (and) (the) (new) (type) (is) (prettier) (than) (what) (they) (used) (to) (look) (like) but I sure don't think it's attractive It's not like driving a little sports car
sw4723.dff	50	B	it's very hard to find something practical that's also attractive
sw4723.dff	51	A	I don't think that happens but I love mine and I bought it because I drove a friend's in Hawaii and I just went home and I walked in and I picked it out and he said take it home and bring it back if you want to and I never did
sw4723.dff	51	A	I just went back and signed the papers and I knew nothing about my car when I got it
sw4723.dff	51	A	(Nothing)
sw4723.dff	51	A	(I) (didn't) (know) (how) (anything) (worked)
sw4723.dff	52	B	so it was a completely new experience for you
sw4723.dff	52	B	And I'm sure you enjoyed every minute of it
sw4723.dff	53	A	And I've had it it's almost three years actually
sw4723.dff	53	A	And I still love it
sw4723.dff	53	A	I put the top down everywhere I go
sw4723.dff	53	A	I timed it when I first got it and it took I mean twenty seconds and so I figured there was nowhere I was to late to go that I didn't have twenty more seconds
sw4723.dff	55	A	(So)
sw4723.dff	56	B	(and) (you) (couldn't) (get) how long does it take to go back up
sw4723.dff	56	B	About the same time
sw4723.dff	57	A	Twenty seconds That's all it takes
sw4723.dff	57	A	it's just a button that's it
sw4723.dff	57	A	(You)
sw4723.dff	58	B	(so)
sw4723.dff	59	A	release it at the top so you don't have to
sw4723.dff	60	B	(So) (you) (won't) (get)
sw4723.dff	61	A	(get) (out) (or) (anything)
sw4723.dff	62	B	and twenty seconds you probably won't get caught in anything too substantial
sw4723.dff	63	A	I did actually
sw4723.dff	63	A	Last week going to the airport I just hit a downpour and I was on a highway going like eighty
sw4723.dff	65	A	So I really did
sw4723.dff	65	A	I was soaking wet
sw4723.dff	65	A	I thought I would drown in the seconds that it took me to pull over
sw4723.dff	66	B	(Whoops)
sw4723.dff	67	A	But it all dried out Didn't
sw4723.dff	69	A	take long when the sun came out but it was kind of funny
sw4723.dff	69	A	I'm sure people around me really enjoyed it (but)
sw4723.dff	70	B	No I was just down in Austin last week and the weather was pretty nice too
sw4723.dff	70	B	(So)
sw4723.dff	71	A	wasn't it pretty last week with the Bluebonnets and everything
sw4723.dff	72	B	(With) (the) (Bluebonnets) (out) It really was
sw4723.dff	72	B	I decided that Austin is certainly someplace that I could handle living
sw4723.dff	73	A	A lot of people say that and it's pretty far from where I live
sw4725.dff	1	A	Regarding taxes
sw4725.dff	1	A	(I) taxes are really a necessary evil in a civilized society
sw4725.dff	1	A	But really people get upset at taxes because it's more efficient to do things yourself
sw4725.dff	3	A	and so as a result it's a trade-off for the common good for the benefit of others How much of your resource should you dedicate to making things work for others
sw4725.dff	3	A	Have you ever thought just how much of that money should go to other people that really don't deserve it
sw4725.dff	4	B	I know it's a lot that I feel (you) (know) just like you said that there's just so much that you can do yourself
sw4725.dff	4	B	That you take care of your own self that you don't need the money for but they're giving it to other people that don't really need it either but yet they accept it
sw4725.dff	5	A	the thing of it is
sw4725.dff	7	A	if I wanted to just permanently become a book reader (I) (guess) I could just go on public assistance
sw4725.dff	8	B	(Like) (so) (many) (people) (do)
sw4725.dff	9	A	look for people to take care of me
sw4725.dff	11	A	And probably a good woman
sw4725.dff	13	A	just con somebody to take care of me
sw4725.dff	13	A	And then you don't have to be on the tax roll
sw4725.dff	15	A	but taxes are very difficult (kind) (of) (thing) and everybody really hates it
sw4725.dff	15	A	It was very timely
sw4725.dff	15	A	I always over pay my deductions so I wind up
sw4725.dff	17	A	getting money back from my withholding
sw4725.dff	19	A	that's always a smile
sw4725.dff	19	A	But of course I've paid it in and I should calculate it better
sw4725.dff	20	B	You
sw4725.dff	22	B	are you in business for yourself
sw4725.dff	23	A	No
sw4725.dff	23	A	I work for the F B I
sw4725.dff	25	A	So I'm a federal employee
sw4725.dff	27	A	(Guess) I don't sound like it
sw4725.dff	28	B	(I) (th-) (no) (I) (think) (that) people that work for the government are just as against taxes as everybody else
sw4725.dff	29	A	I belong
sw4725.dff	30	B	Unless you work for Internal Revenue
sw4725.dff	31	A	I've got all four feet in the trough being a federal employee
sw4725.dff	33	A	but I can understand that who gets benefits
sw4725.dff	33	A	every time there is a bond issue
sw4725.dff	35	A	I vote no on every one of them
sw4725.dff	37	A	(I) but (there) (this) (is) not tax revolt country
sw4725.dff	37	A	there's too many most of us have all four feet in the trough Plus our snout up to our ears
sw4725.dff	39	A	So it's not exactly that kind of a place that you want to get into a tax revolt situation
sw4725.dff	41	A	But the local taxes here (I) in this particular area I think I pay about thirty-five hundred for taxes on my four bedroom house
sw4725.dff	43	A	And which is a lot of money
sw4725.dff	43	A	and so as people get older (and) (older) they think about retirement and that sort of thing
sw4725.dff	45	A	and they're building old people's homes at tax expense
sw4725.dff	45	A	I think the old people ought to just bail out of here and go where it's cheaper
sw4725.dff	45	A	At thirty-three hundred dollars or thirty-five hundred dollars I'm paying in taxes I could go down to Bulverde and probably rent a house for that
sw4725.dff	46	B	(that's)
sw4725.dff	47	A	instead it's the taxes here so
sw4725.dff	49	A	Course I don't know whether I want to go to Bulverde or not
sw4725.dff	51	A	or Seguin or someplace like that
sw4725.dff	53	A	But there's certainly lots of inexpensive places where the services are poorer
sw4725.dff	53	A	and I think really the only place you can really reduce the amount of taxes you pay is to move to an area where the services are poorer
sw4725.dff	53	A	If you're not going to use them then you want to be in environment
sw4725.dff	53	A	That's a strategy I think that the people have to take
sw4725.dff	53	A	is how to be able to lessen their cost of living
sw4725.dff	53	A	I'm five or six years before I'm eligible to retire and I'm saying I really can't stay here as a retiree
sw4725.dff	54	B	(After) (you) (retire)
sw4725.dff	55	A	It's too expensive
sw4725.dff	57	A	I'm going to have go out (you) (know) in East Fork someplace
sw4725.dff	59	A	and do my thing
sw4725.dff	60	B	My parents are in the same situation their home is paid for but still their taxes are so high that my father doesn't feel like he can retire because they couldn't pay their taxes
sw4725.dff	60	B	And they have no children in school or anything now
sw4725.dff	60	B	They don't use any of those services that a lot of the taxes go towards
sw4725.dff	61	A	they redecorated in nineteen seventy-five
sw4725.dff	63	A	And they're not doing it again
sw4725.dff	65	A	(So)
sw4725.dff	65	A	(it's) (certainly) you must be a T I employee
sw4725.dff	66	B	(You) (must) (be) (what)
sw4725.dff	67	A	(You) (must) (be) (a) (T) (I) (employee)
sw4725.dff	68	B	No I'm not
sw4725.dff	69	A	(You're) (not) (a) (T) (I) who do you work for
sw4725.dff	70	B	I don't work
sw4725.dff	70	B	I'm a student
sw4725.dff	70	B	(I) (go) (to) (school)
sw4725.dff	70	B	I'm in nursing school
sw4726.dff	1	A	I'm ready if you are
sw4726.dff	2	B	(Okay)
sw4726.dff	2	B	where do you stand (on)
sw4726.dff	3	A	I think that people should be allowed to have them
sw4726.dff	3	A	Especially
sw4726.dff	5	A	if they go hunting my son goes hunting
sw4726.dff	5	A	He goes deer hunting
sw4726.dff	5	A	He goes duck hunting
sw4726.dff	5	A	he's read books about guns since he was
sw4726.dff	7	A	probably eleven or twelve years old
sw4726.dff	9	A	And I just think that as far as that's concerned he should be able to have them to go hunting (with) As far as
sw4726.dff	11	A	just having handguns around to have them I don't believe that you should have handguns around
sw4726.dff	12	B	(I) (agree) (too)
sw4726.dff	12	B	I as far as the ban goes (and) (everything) I don't think it's possible to completely ban guns
sw4726.dff	12	B	There's just too many
sw4726.dff	13	A	no
sw4726.dff	13	A	There's too many sports people out there that do do these things
sw4726.dff	14	B	(and) (I) (that's) (true)
sw4726.dff	14	B	And the technology's not that hard
sw4726.dff	14	B	you could make a gun from simple
sw4726.dff	15	A	I suppose you could
sw4726.dff	16	B	if you really wanted a gun you could make one
sw4726.dff	17	A	And (I) (think) if they want one they're going to get one
sw4726.dff	20	B	(true)
sw4726.dff	20	B	(That's) (true)
sw4726.dff	21	A	The bad guys (are) (like) (I) (say) (if) (they) want a gun they're going to find out
sw4726.dff	23	A	somehow to get one
sw4726.dff	24	B	(it's) there's no way to stop anybody from getting a gun
sw4726.dff	24	B	I think there should be more control as maybe waiting periods (and) (things) (like) (that)
sw4726.dff	25	A	I agree with you on that because I know in fact I had bought my son a rifle for a Christmas present one time
sw4726.dff	27	A	And for a rifle there's no waiting
sw4726.dff	27	A	There wasn't anyhow
sw4726.dff	27	A	Now there might be now
sw4726.dff	29	A	But
sw4726.dff	31	A	there wasn't anything for rifles and things like that
sw4726.dff	31	A	(I) (guess)
sw4726.dff	32	B	(Sure)
sw4726.dff	33	A	it was just handguns that there was (a) some kind
sw4726.dff	35	A	of a waiting two weeks while they checked you out (or) (something)
sw4726.dff	37	A	(But) (most) (of) (these) (people) (that's) (got) (these) (guns) (that's) (going) (around) (robbing) (people) (and) (shooting) (people)
sw4726.dff	38	B	I know my friend is really into guns and I went a couple of times with him to gun shows that
sw4726.dff	40	B	come through town and (everything) (and) (I) (mean) they have anything you'd want
sw4726.dff	42	B	(anywhere) from rifles and semiautomatic weapons (and) (I) (mean) (there's) (nothing)
sw4726.dff	42	B	You can just go buy one and take it home (and) it's easier than getting (like) a video membership card at a video store
sw4726.dff	43	A	(see) (now) I know they were having a gun show about a month ago and I was just wondering how that did work if somebody wanted to buy a gun at a gun show
sw4726.dff	44	B	You just go and buy the gun (and)
sw4726.dff	45	A	There's no restriction (though)
sw4726.dff	45	A	You don't have to wait (or) (nothing) (then)
sw4726.dff	46	B	(No)
sw4726.dff	46	B	except for the pistols (and) (th-) I'm not sure how they do that
sw4726.dff	46	B	(I) (know) (they)
sw4726.dff	47	A	(I) (was) (just) (curious) (because)
sw4726.dff	49	A	(I) (know) at the regular (you) (know) gun shop
sw4726.dff	51	A	(that) (you)
sw4726.dff	53	A	(that) (you) do have to wait for pistols (like) a couple
sw4726.dff	55	A	of weeks and (then) they check you out then they call you up and you go pick it up
sw4726.dff	56	B	(I) (think) (that's)
sw4726.dff	57	A	(Which) I think they have to do on rifles (and) (things) now too
sw4726.dff	57	A	(I) (think) (there)
sw4726.dff	59	A	(is) (something) (like) (that)
sw4726.dff	59	A	(Anyhow) out here in California (I) (think) (there) (is) (now)
sw4726.dff	61	A	(But)
sw4726.dff	62	B	(I'm) (not) (sure) I'm not really sure what the gun laws in Pennsylvania are (like)
sw4726.dff	63	A	Now we don't have guns because
sw4726.dff	64	B	(No)
sw4726.dff	65	A	we don't go hunting or anything like that
sw4726.dff	67	A	(But) (like) (I) (say) my son (he's)
sw4726.dff	69	A	(he's) (always) (had) (a) I think his first little rifle (that) we got him was he twelve or thirteen years old
sw4726.dff	71	A	But he went to the school to learn how to shoot it
sw4726.dff	71	A	He goes to the pistol range and the rifle range to shoot them
sw4726.dff	71	A	He likes to go to that shotgun thing where you shoot at those
sw4726.dff	72	B	The skeets (you) (mean)
sw4726.dff	73	A	(He) (likes) (to) (do) (that)
sw4726.dff	75	A	(But)
sw4726.dff	77	A	(I) (don't) (know)
sw4726.dff	77	A	I think they should try to control it and everything But as far as just banning it completely that's not going to happen
sw4726.dff	78	B	(I) (don't) (think) (it) (can) (happen) (either)
sw4726.dff	80	B	(I) (don't) (see) (and) (then) (I) (think) hadn't thought about this before but if they would decide to ban guns it would just open up (you) (know) a black market for them
sw4728.dff	18	A	I like the way trucks are built and I don't care about comfort
sw4728.dff	18	A	So I'm pretty happy
sw4728.dff	19	B	(you're) (looking) (at) I got a Toyota Four Runner
sw4728.dff	19	B	I wanted a truck that (I) (wanted) (something) that I could throw people in the back too so I got a Four Runner
sw4728.dff	20	A	So I wouldn't hesitate to get another one
sw4728.dff	20	A	I never buy new so I wouldn't hesitate to get another used truck
sw4728.dff	21	B	You're just like me
sw4728.dff	21	B	I've never bought a new vehicle in my life
sw4728.dff	22	A	And I don't need to pay for the glitz
sw4728.dff	22	A	I'll
sw4728.dff	23	B	(No)
sw4728.dff	24	A	let somebody else have the showroom shine and I'll pay for the rest of it
sw4728.dff	25	B	Let somebody else break it in
sw4728.dff	26	A	And (the) (van) (we're) (sor-) we might go again on a van
sw4728.dff	26	A	we could probably do with something just a little bit larger than a compact in a sedan next time
sw4728.dff	26	A	I'm not sure
sw4728.dff	28	A	we'll have to face it in a couple of years but
sw4728.dff	30	A	(I) (guess) we had a small Toyota wagon
sw4728.dff	32	A	and we were real happy with that because my second requirement after price is low maintenance
sw4728.dff	34	A	And it certainly had that
sw4728.dff	34	A	We didn't do much to it at all
sw4728.dff	37	B	(my) pretty much (the) (same)
sw4728.dff	37	B	(like) (say) I got one of those Toyota Four Runners
sw4728.dff	39	B	and it (pretty) (much) does everything I need it to
sw4728.dff	39	B	it'll tow three thousand pounds so I can tow everything and (it) (I) (can) (throw) I've had eleven people in it before
sw4728.dff	41	B	Believe it or not
sw4728.dff	41	B	And it's real reliable (belie-) (I) (mean) I've had it for almost four years now and up until say two weeks ago it had never had anything wrong with it
sw4728.dff	43	B	And then of course two weeks ago
sw4728.dff	45	B	(it) (decided) (I) (don't) (know) (it's) (the) (strangest) (weirdest) (thing) (in) (the) (world) (but) it blew a head gasket
sw4728.dff	47	B	Didn't do any damage to it
sw4728.dff	47	B	I caught
sw4728.dff	48	A	(How) (at) (how)
sw4728.dff	49	B	it real early
sw4728.dff	50	A	at how many miles
sw4728.dff	51	B	ninety-seven
sw4728.dff	53	B	thousand
sw4728.dff	53	B	So it's not real early
sw4728.dff	54	A	You didn't overheat it
sw4728.dff	55	B	No
sw4728.dff	55	B	Never overheated it
sw4728.dff	55	B	I smelled the coolant
sw4728.dff	57	B	Went out and looked
sw4728.dff	57	B	saw where it was coming from
sw4728.dff	57	B	Drove it to the shop and left it off
sw4728.dff	58	A	(that) (was) ()
sw4728.dff	59	B	And that was it because I have that and (then) (I) (have) a Kawasaki motorcycle
sw4728.dff	61	B	Which is usually my preferred mode of transportation if I can take it and it's not raining
sw4728.dff	63	B	that's sort of my
sw4728.dff	65	B	hobby though more than a vehicle
sw4728.dff	65	B	(it's) (a) (I) (don't) (know) people who buy motorcycles for transportation I think are kidding themselves
sw4728.dff	66	A	I have one colleague that commutes to work on one when it's not raining and he's a (it's) (he's) pretty conservative guy
sw4728.dff	66	A	I don't think it's much of a sport for him
sw4728.dff	66	A	(I) (guess)
sw4728.dff	67	B	I know but I bet you he really enjoys riding it
sw4728.dff	68	A	I'm sure he does
sw4728.dff	69	B	(So) (yo-)
sw4728.dff	71	B	(h-) when was the last time you took your truck out just to go driving
sw4728.dff	74	A	(No)
sw4728.dff	75	B	(And) I go out twice a week on the bike
sw4728.dff	77	B	At least
sw4728.dff	77	B	Just for
sw4728.dff	79	B	the enjoyment
sw4728.dff	81	B	But I mean the only thing I think I might get or not necessarily a new car but another car I would consider going to a normal pickup rather than a covered pickup like the one I've got
sw4728.dff	81	B	Just because there's a lot of times I wished I had just an open bed to throw stuff in
sw4728.dff	83	B	(I'm) (sure) (that) (that's) (very) (you) (got) (one)
sw4728.dff	83	B	(that's) (really) convenient to be able to throw that sort of stuff in the back (and)
sw4728.dff	84	A	If I only had some place that I could store the camper top I would have it off most of the time
sw4728.dff	86	A	I really leave it on there just (just) to have it out of the way because you put it on the ground it gets dirty
sw4728.dff	87	B	(To) (have) (it) (out) (of) (the) (way)
sw4728.dff	88	A	But they're solid
sw4728.dff	88	A	(trucks) (are) (built)
sw4728.dff	89	B	I think they last a lot longer than anything else
sw4728.dff	90	A	They're the only things Americans still know how to build (and)
sw4728.dff	91	B	(the) (trucks) (do)
sw4728.dff	91	B	(even) (though) the little Jap trucks are good there too
sw4728.dff	91	B	But so are the (though) (I) (think) (the) Chevies (I) (don't) (think) (the) (Che-) I don't like the Chevies as much as I like the Fords
sw4728.dff	93	B	I think the Fords tend to last a little longer
sw4728.dff	94	A	I
sw4728.dff	95	B	At least until recently
sw4728.dff	96	A	I kind of like mine (so) mine's a Ford
sw4728.dff	97	B	A friend of mine just bought a year ago
sw4728.dff	97	B	it's a really nice truck
sw4728.dff	97	B	I don't like Dodges at all but one of the Dodges they have out now has the Cummins turbo diesel on it
sw4728.dff	98	A	(I) (heard) (about) (that) (yes)
sw4728.dff	99	B	it's beautiful
sw4728.dff	101	B	that thing will last forever
sw4728.dff	102	A	(that's) (a) (serious) (truck)
sw4728.dff	103	B	(that) (thing's) it's got a boat engine in it
sw4728.dff	104	A	(this) I know a contractor who just got one of those
sw4728.dff	106	A	He's pleased with it
sw4733.dff	1	A	(think) (about) (this)
sw4733.dff	2	B	do you have children in school
sw4733.dff	3	A	I do
sw4733.dff	4	B	I have two that are now just about ready to graduate from college
sw4733.dff	6	B	but I also have two that are just entering school
sw4733.dff	7	A	So you see a big difference then in before and
sw4733.dff	9	A	now (do) (you) (or)
sw4733.dff	10	B	I think they're just pushing them entirely to fast
sw4733.dff	11	A	A lot of testing
sw4733.dff	12	B	it seems to me that kindergarten is now the equivalent of first grade
sw4733.dff	14	B	My son leaves the house at seven thirty and doesn't get home until three o'clock
sw4733.dff	16	B	And I think that's such a long day for a kindergartner
sw4733.dff	17	A	(I) (do) (too) I think that's awful
sw4733.dff	18	B	And I have a preschooler
sw4733.dff	18	B	I was told by her preschool teacher that she thought maybe she was to immature for kindergarten and I thought how mature do you have to be
sw4733.dff	19	A	(I) (know)
sw4733.dff	19	A	What's the new criteria
sw4733.dff	20	B	(And) (there) (is) (a) do you have the standardized testing now
sw4733.dff	21	A	We have all kinds of testing and it's over and over
sw4733.dff	21	A	It's I T B S and just everything
sw4733.dff	23	A	And they test test test
sw4733.dff	23	A	I live in Plano actually and I don't know if you've heard of Plano (but)
sw4733.dff	24	B	No
sw4733.dff	25	A	it's a very transient community
sw4733.dff	25	A	A lot of people from everywhere it's just north of Dallas
sw4733.dff	27	A	and it's grown in leaps and bounds
sw4733.dff	27	A	we must have maybe a hundred and fifty thousand people now
sw4733.dff	29	A	And most of them from other places
sw4733.dff	31	A	J C Penney's come down from New York and of course T I and Xerox from Rochester and we just
sw4733.dff	33	A	have lots of people from everywhere
sw4733.dff	35	A	Lots of industry coming in
sw4733.dff	37	A	and it's a very wealthy community
sw4733.dff	37	A	(not) (that) (I) (am) (but) (other) (people) (seem)
sw4733.dff	57	A	is us and how much of it is Texas but the kids are expected to excel in
sw4733.dff	59	A	everything
sw4733.dff	60	B	(dear)
sw4733.dff	61	A	And it's almost impossible because you have so many children and just so many activities that everybody can't be first and they're
sw4733.dff	63	A	expected to be
sw4733.dff	63	A	their parents expect it the teachers expect it Texas wants very badly to be considered tops in the school system
sw4733.dff	65	A	and if you read national surveys they're far from it
sw4733.dff	65	A	And so there's just a whole lot of testing and a whole lot of pushing to do well on these tests
sw4733.dff	66	B	How about the kids
sw4733.dff	66	B	How are they coping with it
sw4733.dff	67	A	not very well
sw4733.dff	67	A	They bring home notes that say they have to get a good night's sleep
sw4733.dff	69	A	and eat in the morning before
sw4733.dff	71	A	tests
sw4733.dff	71	A	they make a big deal
sw4733.dff	71	A	To me the paper should just be put on the desk that day and say just do this
sw4733.dff	73	A	I just feel they do better that way
sw4733.dff	74	B	(Rather) (than)
sw4733.dff	75	A	(And)
sw4733.dff	76	B	(anticipating)
sw4733.dff	77	A	and I have older children too that now are out of high school and they've always done this here
sw4733.dff	77	A	it's always been the same but it's getting worse and worse is more pressure for everything
sw4733.dff	77	A	And I just think it's really awful and I'm with you on that
sw4733.dff	77	A	You don't hear too many people say this but I think it's a very long day
sw4733.dff	78	B	(it) (is)
sw4733.dff	79	A	And my feeling is that you're only a kid once and you don't want to
sw4733.dff	80	B	(That's)
sw4733.dff	81	A	spend your whole life in school
sw4733.dff	82	B	My son came home and he said Mom all we do is work
sw4733.dff	84	B	We hardly ever play (and)
sw4733.dff	85	A	(And) (I) (don't) (think) (that's) I think we should do what Europe does and include cultural activities in our school system
sw4733.dff	86	B	likewise
sw4733.dff	87	A	I don't think I should have to pay for dancing lessons gymnastics piano
sw4733.dff	89	A	(I) (would) (like) (to) (see) (those) (things) (included) (in) (our) (school) (system)
sw4733.dff	90	B	Wouldn't that be great
sw4733.dff	91	A	because I think we should have well-rounded kids
sw4733.dff	93	A	not just book smart kids
sw4733.dff	95	A	And so I just find this a real problem
sw4733.dff	95	A	I think if they're going to be there all day they should find time
sw4733.dff	95	A	One of my daughters once was out of school with Mono in her junior year I think it was
sw4733.dff	95	A	And she had a home teacher for like four hours a week and when she went back in six weeks she was ahead
sw4733.dff	95	A	So what
sw4733.dff	96	B	(Is) (that)
sw4733.dff	97	A	does that tell you
sw4733.dff	97	A	It tells you there's a whole
sw4733.dff	98	B	(my) (gosh)
sw4733.dff	99	A	lot of wasted time
sw4733.dff	100	B	(my) (gosh)
sw4733.dff	101	A	And they could be using this time better
sw4733.dff	102	B	for example in my son's kindergarten
sw4733.dff	102	B	They're really finished at lunch time
sw4733.dff	102	B	After lunch (they) (have) (some) (I'm) (trying) (to) (think) (if) (they) (have) (recess) (after) (lunch) (and) then they have naps or rest period
sw4735.dff	10	B	that's a good idea to have it as a study program for school where it be more on a voluntary basis
sw4735.dff	12	B	as opposed to mandatory
sw4735.dff	13	A	(Exactly)
sw4735.dff	14	B	(A) I kind of agree with that
sw4735.dff	14	B	I don't think they should have the same rights as anyone else
sw4735.dff	18	B	anything shouldn't be mandatory other than (I) (guess) when you come to paying taxes or something like that
sw4735.dff	18	B	or if it's beneficial in some kind of way then maybe
sw4735.dff	20	B	people be more eager to do it
sw4735.dff	21	A	Exactly
sw4735.dff	23	A	And doing it for a purpose that they want
sw4735.dff	23	A	The other thing is this I have thought about this on many times when you get these young troubled teenagers that don't have (the) (perspective) (of) (the) (community) a sense of community or perhaps the sense that they may have problems but there are other people out in the community that may have problems
sw4735.dff	23	A	Then I can see it as maybe a probationary type of thing
sw4735.dff	23	A	You have to do so much as far as in
sw4735.dff	25	A	community service now
sw4735.dff	25	A	If they were abusive type of situation perhaps then they would have to work with the victims of abuse
sw4735.dff	27	A	Or if they destroyed some property around the area then they would have to restore it and perhaps work for the community to beautify it or whatever but
sw4735.dff	29	A	I could see that working in cases where it might be young teenagers getting in trouble with law and teaching him that there is a whole community that is effected when they strike out and do their crimes or whatever
sw4735.dff	29	A	And I think they have done that and judges have said this is what you're going to get for (you) (know) a misdemeanor or something you may end up having to do some kind of community service (so) (I) (could) (see) (that) (as) (something) (that) (might) (occur) (in) (the) (court) (system) (for) (those) (that) (are) (troubled) (so)
sw4735.dff	30	B	(that's) (a) (good) (idea)
sw4735.dff	30	B	(I) (think) they should have more programs like that
sw4735.dff	32	B	(And) (I) (think) us being taxpayers we pay for people that's in jail or
sw4735.dff	34	B	in trouble anyway
sw4735.dff	35	A	(Sure)
sw4735.dff	35	A	(We) (sure) (do)
sw4735.dff	36	B	So they should be programs set up by the government that could utilize those forms in different areas
sw4735.dff	38	B	And
sw4735.dff	40	B	I agree wholeheartedly
sw4735.dff	42	B	But the thing is is that's not enough of that kind of stuff going on
sw4735.dff	44	B	because like you say is a lot of crimes and stuff or misdemeanors
sw4735.dff	46	B	so why have someone in jail for a year or two for a misdemeanor
sw4735.dff	46	B	And sometimes putting them in jail doesn't really help
sw4735.dff	48	B	because there's nothing in there that would (reb-) rehabilitate (re-)
sw4735.dff	49	A	(Exactly)
sw4735.dff	50	B	(rehabilitate)
sw4735.dff	52	B	(rehabilitate) them
sw4735.dff	54	B	and then when they get out (they) because they have this stigmatism of being in jail
sw4736.dff	1	A	Capital punishment (I) (guess) out in California has had a lot of discourse in the paper
sw4736.dff	1	A	apparently they haven't executed anybody since nineteen sixty-seven (I) (believe)
sw4736.dff	2	B	that's as far back as I can remember
sw4736.dff	2	B	that's before
sw4736.dff	3	A	(they)
sw4736.dff	4	B	my time actually
sw4736.dff	5	A	we lived in Redwood City when we were out there
sw4736.dff	7	A	and we found that it was a very liberal kind of community
sw4736.dff	7	A	But I really feel that the law enforcement community puts these people behind bars and then these lawyer groups get together and they (I) (think) extend beyond the normal appeal process
sw4736.dff	7	A	and just drag this guy his ultimate demise out for ten or fifteen years
sw4736.dff	7	A	and I think that there's something that has to be changed in the system to do that
sw4736.dff	7	A	(I) (think) capital punishment was probably stringent enough but (I) (think) the appeal process is really getting in the way
sw4736.dff	9	A	do you feel as though there should be (or) (or) more you might say transgressions that would be enforceable by capital punishment
sw4736.dff	10	B	I think that currently the way the law stands isn't so much that the laws are enforceable or not it's more they're not enforcing the death penalty itself
sw4736.dff	10	B	It's at that point where they're saying here you're going on death row but you'll stay there for twenty years
sw4736.dff	12	B	And nothing is being done about it
sw4736.dff	12	B	the laws exist and are frequently upheld in Appeals Court just because of technicalities and because of maybe small little holes that their defending attorney can find
sw4736.dff	12	B	And it's really getting out of hand in many states
sw4736.dff	13	A	(the) (term) (technicality)
sw4736.dff	13	A	The law enforcement community
sw4736.dff	15	A	has to separate the difference between somebody who is being set up in which grievous acts are done (you) (know) to get somebody into a situation where they're going to be guilty of a crime
sw4736.dff	17	A	and whether the rights of that individual have been impuned
sw4736.dff	17	A	or whether (you) (know) a policeman has just made a noncritical error though be it not the way to do it but the merits of the case in terms of
sw4736.dff	19	A	the guy was a law breaker as being supportive
sw4736.dff	19	A	I'm at this juncture (you) (know) I'm not sure what constitutes a technicality
sw4736.dff	19	A	that's what all these hearings are about and that's what all these court cases are about
sw4736.dff	19	A	our glorious mayor here in Washington is six days away from getting out of the can and he tried to appeal his conviction
sw4736.dff	19	A	and it didn't work
sw4736.dff	19	A	But be that as it may everybody who got enough money will pump the appeal process dry
sw4736.dff	19	A	in the old days and say round about times of battle of Hastings and the villages if you were a transgressor they either drove you out in the woods or you became a ward of somebody and you were his slave
sw4736.dff	19	A	And if he didn't like what you did he killed you
sw4736.dff	21	A	And that's pretty effective
sw4736.dff	21	A	it's not good for civil rights (I) (guess) but it's pretty effective in that you've got to get along in the community and if you don't you'll perish
sw4736.dff	21	A	Either by the hand of your master or by being pushed out in the woods
sw4736.dff	21	A	I mean as man has gotten more complicated so all of the imaginations to protect him from being dumped on by civilian authority in criminal actions especially murder cases (and) (that) (sort) (of) (thing)
sw4736.dff	22	B	well it seems as if in the past typically there have been a lot of cases of people being wrongly tried or (wrongly) punished and the whole idea behind the current criminal process system is to protect those who actually didn't the crimes albeit it seems that we are failing in that ultimate goal because there are times when people who are guilty are getting off
sw4736.dff	22	B	for instance there's a case a few years back where someone (who's) was going to trial for murder was let off because of a technicality in that
sw4736.dff	22	B	the arresting officer did not read the defendant their rights
sw4736.dff	24	B	And where (his)
sw4736.dff	26	B	old evidence was there the witnesses were there everything was conclusively pointing to this individual (yet)
sw4745.dff	2	B	(I) (agree)
sw4745.dff	3	A	And I look at my daughter (and) she's now going to be four and I keep saying jeez I don't have that much time with her
sw4745.dff	5	A	(And) (she's) (growing) (fast) (and)
sw4745.dff	6	B	(I) (know) (that) I have three children
sw4745.dff	8	B	(And) I stay home
sw4745.dff	8	B	I don't work
sw4745.dff	10	B	(And) I know that it must be really challenging to try to juggle a job and (also) your children
sw4745.dff	10	B	(Because) (I) (know) (my) (husband) (if) (I) (were) (gone) (as) (much) (as) (he) (is)
sw4745.dff	11	A	(Yes)
sw4745.dff	12	B	we wouldn't have the influence on them that I would want (to) (put) (on) (them)
sw4745.dff	13	A	(Sure)
sw4745.dff	13	A	(Exactly)
sw4745.dff	14	B	And I also notice that the children that come over here to play
sw4745.dff	16	B	that go to daycare every day
sw4745.dff	18	B	(they) don't like (to) (be) (around) (adults)
sw4745.dff	20	B	(They) (don't) (want) (to) play around adults
sw4745.dff	20	B	(They) (don't) (want) (to) (be) (around) (you)
sw4745.dff	20	B	They don't want you to tell them what to do
sw4745.dff	20	B	They want to do their own thing
sw4745.dff	21	A	(Sure)
sw4745.dff	22	B	And they're the (very) same age as my children
sw4745.dff	23	A	(Exactly)
sw4745.dff	24	B	And I'm finding as (I) (volunteer) (up) (at) (the) (school) (I) (just) (being) (I'm) (not) (educated) (at) (all) (in) (really) (detecting) (this) (but) I can talk to the teacher and tell them on a pretty good basis after I've worked up at the school for a couple of weeks
sw4745.dff	26	B	which kids go to daycare and which kids stay home
sw4745.dff	27	A	(Sure) (sure)
sw4745.dff	28	B	And you can just tell in their personalities and how they respond to the adults the ones that are home and the ones even that are at home that are getting the love and attention that they need
sw4745.dff	30	B	Not that the kids that go out aren't getting that
sw4745.dff	32	B	it's just a different they are more use to being with their own age kids
sw4745.dff	33	A	(Sure)
sw4745.dff	34	B	they're not use to being with adults and to responding
sw4745.dff	35	A	(Sure)
sw4745.dff	36	B	(to) (adults)
sw4745.dff	37	A	(Sure)
sw4745.dff	37	A	(I)
sw4745.dff	38	B	I think the trend in the United States I feel really bad that it's turned so much
sw4745.dff	39	A	I think so too
sw4745.dff	40	B	(to) (where) (the) (children) (are)
sw4745.dff	41	A	(In) (fact) I spent the first three years at home with my daughter so (I) (guess) I felt fairly fortunate that I was able to do that
sw4745.dff	41	A	And I did notice the difference between those (of) infants being placed in daycare (and) I thought to myself how can a mother place her child at the age of six weeks or four weeks or two weeks or three weeks whatever the employer says you have to be back at work is basically when you have to be back at work whether it be six weeks or three or four
sw4745.dff	41	A	But how these women must feel to place their children into care (and) it's our society saying yes you need this job
sw4745.dff	41	A	It's a little bit financial (type) (thing) because if you look (all) (over) in (the) other countries like Europe (and) (that) their standards of living are a lot less than what ours are and
sw4745.dff	43	A	that's part of it too
sw4745.dff	43	A	But like my husband was saying maybe some of the problems we brought on to ourselves is that these women back in the nineteen fifties were staying at home with their kids and then made the decision (jeez) I'll go out and get a part-time job
sw4745.dff	43	A	(Got) (a) (part-time) (job) and then financially they got themselves into I'll have the boat I'll have the car and
sw4745.dff	45	A	it's nice (and) really past generation women have done it to women of this day and age too because our financial situations are (as) it almost takes two people to bring in an income to support a family now (and)
sw4745.dff	46	B	(It's) (hard)
sw4745.dff	46	B	It really is hard
sw4745.dff	46	B	I know that my husband and I have to do a lot of sacrificing
sw4745.dff	48	B	to keep me home
sw4745.dff	49	A	(Sure) I did it
sw4745.dff	50	B	(And)
sw4745.dff	51	A	for three years and it cost us a lot of financial problems doing it and pretty soon you're at the limit where you've got to say okay you've sacrificed for so many years at home and you're not getting any further along
sw4745.dff	53	A	and you have to make that decision to go back to work part-time or go back to work full-time and you (have) (to) (make) (that) (decision) and it's a tough one
sw4745.dff	54	B	(I) (think)
sw4745.dff	55	A	(And) (I)
sw4745.dff	56	B	one of the things that people look at too though is how they spend their time with their children
sw4745.dff	58	B	I think with working moms if you can get the bosses to give you almost a rotation like they're going to do with year-round school where you work
sw4745.dff	59	A	(Sure)
sw4752.dff	1	A	I'm ready
sw4752.dff	1	A	in Atlanta Georgia you probably have a lot more crime than we have here in Patterson California
sw4752.dff	2	B	could be
sw4752.dff	3	A	this little city is only about eight thousand people
sw4752.dff	5	A	(So)
sw4752.dff	6	B	we is crime a problem there
sw4752.dff	6	B	a major problem minor problem (or)
sw4752.dff	7	A	in Patterson (there's) it's not a problem here
sw4752.dff	7	A	But I lived in Oakland until just recently
sw4752.dff	9	A	and Oakland California God they've had sixty-seven murders so far this year compared to forty at this time last year
sw4752.dff	11	A	So it's really bad there
sw4752.dff	13	A	and it's all related to drugs it seems like
sw4752.dff	15	A	Is that what it's there too
sw4752.dff	16	B	I've only been here for probably just over six months (I) (start) I
sw4752.dff	18	B	started school here
sw4752.dff	18	B	I came from a smaller town in in New York
sw4752.dff	20	B	and the city was or not real big but we had a problem there but here there's just no comparison (that) much more crime
sw4752.dff	22	B	every night the news is very depressing because they run down the list of how many people were shot drive by shootings or
sw4752.dff	24	B	whatever and it's pretty bad
sw4752.dff	24	B	(they're) (it's) things have basically improved here over the last few years
sw4752.dff	24	B	they've actually taken steps to try to make it better but it still is a problem
sw4752.dff	25	A	I don't know what they can do to make it better unless they just hire more policemen
sw4752.dff	26	B	that seems to be what they were doing and they've stepped up more patrols in certain areas and it has
sw4752.dff	28	B	(has) made some places safer but it's very difficult
sw4752.dff	28	B	if you don't have an infinite amount of money to (to) try to stop the problem although most people wish you could
sw4752.dff	30	B	it's definitely a problem and
sw4752.dff	32	B	the less that's done about it the more it seems it tends to spread into smaller areas unfortunately
sw4752.dff	33	A	I think that if they would do something to these people that they do catch instead of just slapping their little hands
sw4752.dff	35	A	(you) (know) then maybe those other people would be kind of scared and they would not do these bad things
sw4752.dff	36	B	I think (that) (it's) (seems) (to) (be) (that) (I) (don't) (know) some people (they) (do) (something) they shoot somebody or whatever they (go) (to) (jail) sentenced to jail for thirty years they're out in five and they're back on the street and then they shoot someone else and just a cycle and it seems as though the system doesn't tend to stop them unless something drastic is done
sw4752.dff	37	A	I (just) don't understand our laws here
sw4752.dff	37	A	Because in other countries (man) they're really a lot stricter than we are
sw4752.dff	38	B	(It's) (definitely) (true)
sw4752.dff	38	B	It seems as though we try to play humanitarian (I) (think) a little to much and maybe some of the people don't deserve the humanitarian treatment that they get
sw4752.dff	40	B	But I don't know
sw4752.dff	40	B	It's a difficult situation I think and something has to be done because I definitely think it really reeks havoc with your quality of life when you can see it's going on around you but then when once it finally affects you then it really starts to bother you
sw4752.dff	42	B	But it seems people have moved out of the city because they want to get away from the crime and so they tend to spread the cities farther and farther out but it's only a matter of time before it still catches up with them
sw4752.dff	42	B	You can't really run away from the problem
sw4752.dff	44	B	and (you) (know) something has to be done but just that too many people argue about how to fix it
sw4752.dff	45	A	I know when I lived in Oakland it was just that I definitely wouldn't go into certain areas of the city by myself
sw4758.dff	1	A	(I'm) (are) (you) (there)
sw4758.dff	2	B	(Yes) (yes)
sw4758.dff	3	A	(Okay)
sw4758.dff	3	A	I'm sure that I probably prescribe to different ones that you do
sw4758.dff	3	A	I take DOLL READER and DOLL WORLD
sw4758.dff	4	B	Different set
sw4758.dff	5	A	Because I collect dolls
sw4758.dff	5	A	I also take BETTER HOMES AND GARDENS
sw4758.dff	7	A	(I) (like) (that)
sw4758.dff	7	A	And then my husband (he) (just) subscribed to a wood he just started a woodwork so he just sent away to get some woodworking books
sw4758.dff	9	A	what kind do you get
sw4758.dff	10	B	I have a bunch of computer journals
sw4758.dff	12	B	because I'm in computer science but beyond that lately I've been reading I've always liked the NEW YORKER
sw4758.dff	14	B	And lately I've been picking up both trade magazines and just the general travel magazines
sw4758.dff	16	B	trying to keep up on what's going on
sw4758.dff	16	B	my
sw4758.dff	17	A	(Is) (it)
sw4758.dff	18	B	wife also gets a lot of the food magazines
sw4758.dff	18	B	BON APPETITE and FOOD AND WINE and GOURMET
sw4758.dff	19	A	I used to take that
sw4758.dff	20	B	(And) she still likes to get TIME
sw4758.dff	22	B	which I've never liked very much (but) (she) (seems) (to)
sw4758.dff	23	A	I (you) (know) if I happen to find it I'll go ahead and read it someplace (if) (I'm) (in) a doctor's office or something (like) (that) but (other) (than) (that) I never liked that (really)
sw4758.dff	24	B	Do you read a newspaper
sw4758.dff	25	A	I read my newspaper
sw4758.dff	27	A	I can hardly wait in the mornings for the newspaper
sw4758.dff	29	A	to get here (So) (I) (do) (like) (to) (read) (the) (newspaper)
sw4758.dff	29	A	(even) this little newspaper that Patterson puts out
sw4758.dff	29	A	(In) (fact) (it) (puts) (it) (out) on Tuesdays and Thursdays
sw4758.dff	29	A	I (can) (hardly) (wait) (to) (get) (that) (to) get the local news
sw4758.dff	29	A	(But) other than that magazines (I) (don't) (know)
sw4758.dff	29	A	There's so much advertising in them (anymore)
sw4758.dff	30	B	Some of them I used to get for the advertising
sw4758.dff	30	B	Like BYTE magazine which is one (of) (the)
sw4758.dff	31	A	(okay)
sw4758.dff	32	B	larger computer ones
sw4758.dff	32	B	I haven't bought it now for about eight years
sw4758.dff	34	B	(But) when I used to get it it was about five hundred pages about three hundred of them advertising
sw4758.dff	36	B	Because that was interesting
sw4758.dff	36	B	I think a lot of the trade magazines are like that
sw4758.dff	38	B	that half the fun is finding out what all the products are
sw4758.dff	40	B	But some (of) (the) get ridiculous
sw4758.dff	40	B	TRAVEL AND LEISURE all (of) the AMERICAN EXPRESS magazines
sw4758.dff	42	B	(so) (TRAVEL) (AND) (LEISURE) (FOOD) (AND) (WINE) (and) (I) (think) (they) (have) (some) (others) (certainly) half the pages and maybe more are pure ads plus they have the advertising supplement sections that are supposed to look like articles but are paid for (and)
sw4758.dff	44	B	(it's) (clear) (that) I've bought some of these through wholesalers and they don't care if they make any money on the magazine subscription they're making everything on ads
sw4758.dff	45	A	I only subscribe to the things I'm interested in
sw4758.dff	45	A	I used to be into coin collecting so I used to get the coin magazine the paper actually is what it was (I) (used) (to) (get) (that)
sw4758.dff	45	A	So now that I'm into dolls that's about
sw4758.dff	47	A	all I really want
sw4758.dff	48	B	Have you ever read or subscribe to CONSUMER REPORTS for any length of time
sw4758.dff	49	A	No I think they're interesting
sw4758.dff	50	B	But not worth it
sw4758.dff	52	B	(I've) (always) (had) (this) one of the reasons I like just to pick up magazines in other fields is that you seem to get a very different perspective
sw4758.dff	54	B	So I've always had this problem with CONSUMER REPORTS that in the areas that I know a lot about I disagree with them
sw4758.dff	56	B	And I always wonder whether there are people who know a lot about every area disagreeing with them on everything
sw4758.dff	58	B	or what's going on
sw4758.dff	60	B	So (like) I've picked up now a subscription to one of the travel agent organization magazines and it's a ridiculous difference when you start reading from their perspective
sw4758.dff	60	B	their major interest is in commissions and there's very little talk about the quality of places or airlines
sw4758.dff	60	B	Their major talk is about commissions and commission rebates and how they won't suggest hotels to people if the commission's not the full ten percent or whatever it is and
sw4758.dff	62	B	it gives you a different perspective on what people do
sw4758.dff	63	A	those travel magazines more or less show you different countries that you could go to (or)
sw4758.dff	64	B	some of them
sw4758.dff	64	B	the general travel magazines do
sw4758.dff	64	B	I don't tend to read it for that
sw4758.dff	66	B	Because I don't expect to be traveling overseas in the future for quite awhile
sw4758.dff	68	B	But I usually just read through the sections on domestic stuff
sw4758.dff	69	A	(Okay)
sw4758.dff	69	A	I don't know any other magazines I could talk to you about
sw4758.dff	70	B	(No)
sw4758.dff	71	A	I don't take anymore than that
sw4758.dff	72	B	I don't take much more in myself
sw4758.dff	73	A	so
sw4758.dff	74	B	(Okay)
sw4758.dff	75	A	I guess that will be it then and
sw4758.dff	76	B	(Okay) nice talking to you
sw4759.dff	1	A	Okay
sw4759.dff	1	A	we keep a monthly budget
sw4759.dff	1	A	I just recently stopped working so I can be home with my kids so we keep a monthly budget and we try to stick to it
sw4759.dff	2	B	(I) (know)
sw4759.dff	2	B	it's really difficult here
sw4759.dff	2	B	All because there's always something breaking
sw4759.dff	2	B	Car needs tires or something
sw4759.dff	3	A	That's the kind of things that throw you off
sw4759.dff	4	B	we do ours more monthly than long range
sw4759.dff	4	B	(we) my husband gets paid once a month
sw4759.dff	6	B	and when he gets paid I pay all the bills
sw4759.dff	8	B	And out of his check they take a savings and out of my check (they) (take) (savings)
sw4759.dff	10	B	and retirement both out of (both) checks
sw4759.dff	12	B	So as far as extra savings we really don't have that much extra to save
sw4759.dff	14	B	his check once a month pays all the bills
sw4759.dff	14	B	My check weekly buys groceries and gas (and)
sw4759.dff	15	A	(how) (nice)
sw4759.dff	16	B	that kind of thing
sw4759.dff	18	B	and it works out real well that way
sw4759.dff	18	B	We don't run into a lot of problems
sw4759.dff	20	B	but
sw4759.dff	22	B	budgets are horrible
sw4759.dff	23	A	(I) (know)
sw4759.dff	23	A	We do my husband gets paid twice a week and so we pay all of the little bills one
sw4759.dff	25	A	paycheck and then the mortgage and the electric bill those big bills the second
sw4759.dff	27	A	second pay and then again he does have a savings that comes out for Christmas and stuff (that) (kind) (of) (thing)
sw4759.dff	28	B	When the car insurance is due and you call the credit union and tell them send me some money
sw4759.dff	29	A	(that) (kind) (of) (thing)
sw4759.dff	30	B	it would be nice if we didn't have to touch the money he has taken out and put in savings but we do
sw4759.dff	31	A	But it's nice that it's there
sw4759.dff	32	B	(it) I'm just glad that it is there for
sw4759.dff	34	B	car insurance medical bills whatever happens
sw4759.dff	36	B	(But)
sw4759.dff	37	A	It's nice that it's there
sw4759.dff	38	B	(I) (know)
sw4759.dff	38	B	(But) (you) it's just really is difficult
sw4759.dff	38	B	neither one of us has had a raise in a couple of years
sw4759.dff	40	B	And of course the cost of living keeps going up so much
sw4759.dff	42	B	Groceries are outrageous and I keep saying my check does less and less (but)
sw4759.dff	43	A	That's kind of how I felt when I was working because it seemed like we spent more
sw4759.dff	45	A	We bought more things and it seemed like we spent more
sw4759.dff	45	A	Then a lot of it was going to daycare (and) (that) (kind) (of) (thing)
sw4759.dff	47	A	So it just seems like with me staying home we had that big cut but we save more
sw4759.dff	47	A	I don't know how and I don't know why (but) (we)
sw4759.dff	49	A	it seems like we do
sw4759.dff	50	B	I know that since I do work I buy a lot of quicker cuts of meat and
sw4759.dff	52	B	the frozen things for the microwave and things like that
sw4759.dff	53	A	you kind of try and buy bigger quantities
sw4759.dff	54	B	And I'll stop by the deli and pick up chicken or whatever
sw4759.dff	54	B	Where if I did not work I'm sure that the grocery bill could be managed a lot better
sw4759.dff	55	A	(That's) (how) (I) (felt) (too)
sw4759.dff	55	A	It just you could take a little longer
sw4759.dff	55	A	And
sw4759.dff	57	A	just watch a little bit more I guess
sw4759.dff	58	B	(y-)
sw4759.dff	59	A	I guess that's kind of like the way we do
sw4759.dff	59	A	I don't know how it comes out
sw4759.dff	59	A	It just seems like we save a little bit more whereas
sw4759.dff	61	A	where I was working
sw4759.dff	62	B	(I'm) (sure) (you) (do)
sw4759.dff	62	B	well I do not have to pay child care during the winter
sw4759.dff	62	B	My son's old enough that he likes to come home
sw4759.dff	64	B	(from) (school)
sw4759.dff	64	B	(But) in the summer he's still young enough that I cannot leave him by himself
sw4759.dff	66	B	So (in) (the) (summer) I have that extra and ours is seventy dollars a week plus all activities
sw4759.dff	68	B	and that's usually movies one day skating one day
sw4759.dff	70	B	Swimming one day
sw4759.dff	71	A	It adds up
sw4759.dff	72	B	Yes
sw4759.dff	72	B	So you usually end up paying close to eighty dollars a week and that's a lot of money
sw4759.dff	73	A	it is
sw4759.dff	73	A	(It) (is)
sw4759.dff	74	B	But if they're going to be in daycare then they need to have some activities other than just being there
sw4759.dff	76	B	(Ho-) do you have two children
sw4759.dff	77	A	I have two
sw4759.dff	77	A	One is four and a half and the other one's two and a half (so)
sw4759.dff	78	B	they're expensive too
sw4759.dff	78	B	(just) (the)
sw4759.dff	79	A	(Yes)
sw4759.dff	80	B	(outgrowing) (of) (their) (clothes) (so) (I'm) (sure) (the) (budget)
sw4759.dff	81	A	(that) I just came back to find jeans for the little one and it does add up
sw4759.dff	83	A	(But)
sw4759.dff	84	B	And medical bill
sw4759.dff	86	B	Although the insurance we had was good when Thomas was younger
sw4759.dff	86	B	A lot of the stuff had to be paid up front and then you were reimbursed
sw4759.dff	86	B	So it was nice when you'd get a couple of hundred dollar check from the
sw4759.dff	88	B	insurance (but) (in) (the) (meantime) (you) (had) (to) (put) (out) (the) (money) (first)
sw4759.dff	90	B	(But)
sw4759.dff	91	A	that's hard
sw4759.dff	92	B	it is
sw4759.dff	93	A	But I'm enjoying my stay home for the little time that I can
sw4759.dff	94	B	I would too
sw4759.dff	95	A	(For) (the)
sw4759.dff	96	B	(I) (would) (advise) (anyone) (that) (could) (possibly) (do) (it) (to)
sw4759.dff	97	A	I know it's not forever and that's what's so sad (but)
sw4759.dff	98	B	you probably wouldn't want to do it forever
sw4759.dff	98	B	(I) (don't) (know) (though)
sw4765.dff	13	A	and putting that guy into therapy to break this activity
sw4765.dff	13	A	Of course if he's fallen in love with drugs and there isn't anything but getting stoned or high is the only thing in life that seems to be meaningful then maybe there is no hope
sw4765.dff	15	A	What's your feeling
sw4765.dff	16	B	I guess I'm probably a little more toward the other direction
sw4765.dff	18	B	I guess mainly because (I) there's two sides to it (I) (guess)
sw4765.dff	18	B	one is that if you're coming to work under the influence of any sort of drug alcohol (whatever) or even if it's smoking inhibits your ability to function then I think that I don't have any problem at all with testing that individual on the spot
sw4765.dff	18	B	but I guess I feel more like whatever you're doing in your own private life is your own private business
sw4765.dff	18	B	and I guess part of the reason there is because of the fact that things like drug laws seem to come and go
sw4765.dff	18	B	we had prohibition for awhile and then we didn't (have) (prohibition)
sw4765.dff	18	B	we've had (I) (guess) laws against various other forms of drugs for the last (what) sixty or seventy years (I) (guess)
sw4765.dff	20	B	Maybe a little longer
sw4765.dff	21	A	I think the first morphine laws were like (ninety) (or) nineteen ten (or) (nineteen) (five) something like that
sw4765.dff	22	B	eighty years or so
sw4765.dff	24	B	(so) (I) it's hard I guess for me to justify what seems like basically a breach of the (you) (know) freedom from search and seizure on something that may or may not stand as a law fifty years from now or even twenty or ten who knows
sw4765.dff	25	A	(the) (thing) (of) (it) (is) (the) (the) (tha-) (tha-)
sw4765.dff	26	B	prohibition certainly didn't last
sw4765.dff	27	A	(that) (that) (is) (in) in many respects just just I think an over simplification
sw4765.dff	27	A	(I) I think (th-) (th-) there's so much criminal activity that people go into to to support drug habits
sw4765.dff	28	B	but you got to look at prohibition though
sw4765.dff	28	B	You had the same problems there
sw4765.dff	29	A	they support drug habits you know with things like burglary or prostitution (or) (stuff) (like) (that)
sw4765.dff	30	B	(Sure)
sw4765.dff	30	B	it goes back to that (again) if you look at prohibition
sw4765.dff	30	B	because it's illegal it costs more
sw4765.dff	30	B	If it was legal face it you can buy pharmaceutical grade cocaine for what ten or twenty dollars an ounce
sw4765.dff	31	A	(I) (must) (admit) (that)
sw4765.dff	32	B	(And) clearly if you're into coke and all you want to do is snort your brains out all day long if it was legal you could do it real cheap and you'd be a menace to nobody but yourself as long as you stayed at home and did it
sw4765.dff	34	B	(But) (get)
sw4765.dff	35	A	I must admit that the production costs of these drugs are zippo compared to the street market costs and the costs to society
sw4765.dff	36	B	that's why there's people dealing it because there's money in it There's ridiculous amounts of money
sw4765.dff	37	A	But I think that being in law enforcement I probably have a kind of a draconian Philistine attitude toward it
sw4765.dff	39	A	but I really feel as though the interdiction effort is as soon as you get rid of one goon that's involved in drugs (and) (tha-)
sw4765.dff	40	B	(interdiction's) (hopeless)
sw4765.dff	41	A	(and) then another one will jump up
sw4765.dff	42	B	there's no way you're ever going to win that
sw4765.dff	43	A	(But) (we) see
sw4765.dff	44	B	The tighter you squeeze the more the price goes up the more incentive there is
sw4765.dff	44	B	that's a losing fight
sw4765.dff	45	A	(as) (soon) (as) (we) (wind) (up) (for) if we can just destroy the market by destroying the demand but people
sw4765.dff	47	A	want to get stoned (and) (I) (don't) (see) (that)
sw4765.dff	48	B	It goes back to what can society impose on people
sw4765.dff	48	B	can you force somebody to be a good productive citizen
sw4765.dff	50	B	I don't think you can
sw4765.dff	50	B	you know was raised with being a very strong Bible work ethic so I'm one of these ten twelve fifteen twenty hour a day type people
sw4765.dff	52	B	So I can really relate to everybody ought to do their own share I don't have any love lost for people who are on the public dole just because they're too lazy to get a job or that kind of stuff
sw4765.dff	54	B	(But)
sw4770.dff	1	A	I don't know
sw4770.dff	1	A	My personal perception of government and the way things are at this current time is that nobody can really be trusted
sw4770.dff	1	A	And I don't feel that too many of the candidates are out there to be self-serving to the community
sw4770.dff	1	A	I think that they have their own wishes to be in the limelight and to (kind) (of) say hey I'm a public official I don't have to do certain things and they just stand out more
sw4770.dff	1	A	Involving themselves more and more with politics but it's really after all the things that I've seen in the last ten years about government and now the overdrafts of checks before that it was the wonderful escapade that they had with the new (God) chief of Supreme Court (I'm) (trying) (to) (think) (of) (his) (name) and what they put him through in regards to
sw4770.dff	2	B	Thomas
sw4770.dff	3	A	Thomas
sw4770.dff	5	A	The sexual harassment that kind of thing and just to see our government react to that and then just little things that have added up where people have taken vacations on taxpayers' monies (and) (things) (like) (that)
sw4770.dff	5	A	(I) (just) (think) it's very corrupt and whether or not they need to start with people that are extremely poor
sw4770.dff	7	A	and send them into government versus people that are rich
sw4770.dff	7	A	But it's always the rich person that gets into government
sw4770.dff	7	A	That has the money to advertise the money to do this
sw4770.dff	7	A	There's no more Abraham Lincolns out there that can get into government even if they were poor
sw4770.dff	7	A	So I know that's my personal viewpoint of things
sw4770.dff	8	B	Doesn't Wisconsin have a state Medicare program or health program
sw4770.dff	9	A	they've already put through the health bill
sw4770.dff	9	A	Yes
sw4770.dff	9	A	It just went through and it was passed and that is going to be a heavier tax burden on a lot of the taxpayers and a little bit more on to the medical
sw4770.dff	9	A	I don't know if that was done out of just let's be the first state to do it or if it was done really for the needs of the people
sw4770.dff	9	A	You know what I'm saying
sw4770.dff	9	A	(it's) now every little state around here is thinking about we need to reform the health system and of course they think or Minnesota our neighbor passed a state law the health bill and it's kind of like we're the first to do it
sw4770.dff	9	A	So I don't know if it's done because we want to be standing out as being innovative in the health system or whether it was done for a real good purpose to help people that can't afford health insurance that kind of thing
sw4770.dff	10	B	I think one of the biggest problems (that) we see in government today is a reflection of society in and of itself
sw4770.dff	11	A	(sure)
sw4770.dff	12	B	(And) (that) (is) we become so debt ridden and credit oriented
sw4770.dff	13	A	(sure)
sw4770.dff	14	B	instead of cash and carry or debt free
sw4770.dff	16	B	(and) (therefore) that puts a lot of undue pressure on municipalities state and federal governments
sw4770.dff	17	A	it sure does
sw4770.dff	17	A	And
sw4770.dff	19	A	(I) (think) it is reflecting
sw4770.dff	19	A	Like you said (I) (think) society as a whole you can't expect when we have T V -s and we have things that are kind of bombarded at us for immorality (and) (this) (and) (this) (and) (this) that we can expect somebody to come off that's going to be totally clean
sw4770.dff	21	A	(And) (come) (into) (government)
sw4770.dff	21	A	but down the line it does hurt
sw4770.dff	21	A	when somebody's corrupt and somebody's doing something you know it does hurt each individual of the society when you find out that somebody's done something or the overdraft policy or the other things that have occurred (so)
sw4770.dff	22	B	(what) (is) (the) (thing) (is) when a lot of things become acceptable practice
sw4770.dff	24	B	it's hard to discern what has become muddy as to what is ethical and what is not ethical
sw4770.dff	24	B	And then
sw4770.dff	25	A	(Exactly)
sw4770.dff	26	B	someone blows the whistle and says this is not ethical and I did it too
sw4770.dff	29	A	that's exactly what happens in government all the time
sw4770.dff	29	A	(They) (blow) (the) (whistle) (on) (each) (other)
sw4770.dff	29	A	I hear that you're doing this I've done it but (boy) (and) it's not going to get out
sw4770.dff	29	A	exactly
sw4770.dff	29	A	(It's) there's no
sw4770.dff	30	B	(we) (just) (had)
sw4770.dff	31	A	secrets in the government
sw4770.dff	33	A	I don't think anymore
sw4770.dff	34	B	The mayor of Dallas is Steve Bartlett
sw4770.dff	36	B	He also was a congressman
sw4770.dff	38	B	(to) (Congress)
sw4770.dff	40	B	And he had been in that position for years
sw4770.dff	41	A	(Sure)
sw4770.dff	42	B	And he was elected mayor of Dallas
sw4770.dff	44	B	overwhelmingly
sw4770.dff	46	B	However if the vote was taken today the whole thing might change because he was part of that check kiting scam
sw4770.dff	47	A	(sure)
sw4770.dff	47	A	(I) (don't) (think)
sw4774.dff	1	A	Been on the line for awhile
sw4774.dff	1	A	I almost forgot what the topic was
sw4774.dff	2	B	(Okay)
sw4774.dff	2	B	(based)
sw4774.dff	3	A	but I know what it is
sw4774.dff	4	B	(okay)
sw4774.dff	4	B	(Good)
sw4774.dff	7	A	let me see
sw4774.dff	7	A	(I'm) (kind) (of) (I) (don't) I'm kind of in the middle
sw4774.dff	7	A	(I) (think) it's a great idea
sw4774.dff	9	A	but when it comes to me it's almost an insult so it's I've come from the teaching field
sw4774.dff	10	B	(So) (do) (I)
sw4774.dff	11	A	so it's (just) like I don't know
sw4774.dff	11	A	(I) (guess) I'd have to go with I'd be for it
sw4774.dff	13	A	But I don't know
sw4774.dff	13	A	It's just kind of a delicate subject (I) (guess)
sw4774.dff	13	A	But I would probably go for going ahead and doing it If it's got to be done for everyone
sw4774.dff	14	B	(I) (think) if it's got to be done for one person in the company it should be random testing it should be for everybody
sw4774.dff	16	B	when they answer the company I think it'll make it a lot easier
sw4774.dff	18	B	and they'd run into less problems
sw4774.dff	20	B	Because (I) (don't) (know) I come from the teaching field too and it sort of it's a pro and a con (ty-) I don't know where to stand on it
sw4774.dff	22	B	I'm more or less if they told me I had to then fine but
sw4774.dff	24	B	(you) (know) if they made me then (I'd) (probably) if I had my druthers I'd probably say no (just) (this)
sw4774.dff	25	A	You kind of goes into your privacy and
sw4774.dff	27	A	but I (guess) (if) (they) (there's) (I) (guess) there's some companies that aren't that are doing it
sw4774.dff	29	A	And it seems to be working out (so)
sw4774.dff	30	B	(I) (think) (I) (don't) (know) up here in Massachusetts (anyhow) what they're basically trying to do is any people who had tested positively getting them into a drug program
sw4774.dff	32	B	Or rehab program
sw4774.dff	34	B	And anybody who (is) doesn't accept the rehab program then they're (more) (or) (less) getting laid off
sw4774.dff	35	A	that's hard
sw4774.dff	36	B	I think that's really hard (to) because you never know
sw4774.dff	36	B	I don't know it's really weird issue
sw4774.dff	36	B	I'm sort of
sw4774.dff	38	B	on the fence about it
sw4774.dff	40	B	But I that's what's they're coming across as some of the companies anyhow
sw4774.dff	40	B	we can get you into a drug program
sw4774.dff	40	B	But then you wear that stigma
sw4774.dff	44	B	Where a lot of people are saying I only smoked a joint last night I don't have any problems
sw4774.dff	46	B	Or something like that
sw4774.dff	47	A	Then I kind of hear like this is just something I've heard that it kind of goes into just your off the counter medication that you could be taking for a cold
sw4774.dff	47	A	That it kind of affects that too
sw4774.dff	48	B	(Anything) (with) (a) if you drink a lot of caffeine (or)
sw4774.dff	49	A	I didn't know that
sw4774.dff	50	B	somebody was telling me if you drink (it) (in)
sw4774.dff	52	B	an awful lot of caffeine that that can show up as a positive test
sw4774.dff	54	B	I know I'm an epileptic so I'd probably test positive (and)
sw4774.dff	55	A	(things) (like) (that) (so)
sw4774.dff	56	B	and then I'd have a heck of a time explaining what drug is in my system
sw4774.dff	58	B	And a lot of times those are the things I don't like to disclose to an employer because then they don't want to have anything to do with you
sw4774.dff	60	B	it's very personal
sw4774.dff	60	B	I wouldn't want to have it disclosed because
sw4774.dff	61	A	(See) (that's)
sw4774.dff	62	B	then I'd always wonder if they fired me why did you fire me
sw4774.dff	63	A	That's where I kind of get into cause it kind of gets into your personal life (And)
sw4774.dff	65	A	what's (kind) (of) next
sw4774.dff	66	B	it hits me as the Orwell thing
sw4774.dff	66	B	Big brother is watching
sw4774.dff	67	A	The what
sw4774.dff	68	B	Orwell
sw4774.dff	70	B	And his book
sw4774.dff	70	B	big brother is watching
sw4774.dff	72	B	you're being controlled
sw4774.dff	74	B	That type of deal (and) (I) (sh-) (you) (know) I don't know
sw4774.dff	74	B	Seems awful strange
sw4774.dff	74	B	I'd hate to have to if I had my choice between a company that did testing and a company who didn't
sw4774.dff	76	B	I'd probably take the company who didn't
sw4774.dff	78	B	Because I feel there'd be more trust in the employee
sw4774.dff	80	B	But I can understand why they need it with all the train accidents and everything else
sw4774.dff	81	A	So do you think they'll (kind) (of) push into the teaching field eventually
sw4774.dff	81	A	I (kind) (of) think they will
sw4774.dff	82	B	I think they will too because it's just going to follow
sw4774.dff	84	B	I don't know
sw4774.dff	84	B	we haven't had any of it in our school system
sw4774.dff	84	B	(So)
sw4774.dff	85	A	We haven't either
sw4774.dff	86	B	(hopefully) (we) (won't)
sw4774.dff	87	A	But I just kind of think it's heading that way though because it's just hitting to close to home with the kids and stuff and (I) (just)
sw4774.dff	89	A	I just kind of think it's going to eventually head that way
sw4774.dff	90	B	and eventually it's going to be not only (the) (tea-) the kids are
sw4774.dff	92	B	going to be under scrutiny it's going to be the teachers
sw4774.dff	94	B	And if they can test the teachers that gives them the full to test the kids
sw4774.dff	96	B	And then they caught everybody
sw4784.dff	1	A	(I) (guess) it's an easy one for me
sw4784.dff	1	A	(I) (think) there's something seriously wrong
sw4784.dff	2	B	What is it that you are particularly upset about
sw4784.dff	3	A	(I) (think) they've lost their compass and I'm not sure they know exactly what public education supposed to be for anymore
sw4784.dff	3	A	But I voted with my feet and my kids go to parochial school
sw4784.dff	6	B	What do you feel that your kids are getting in the parochial schools that they wouldn't get in the public school system
sw4784.dff	7	A	one hundred percent of the customers care
sw4784.dff	7	A	That's one thing
sw4784.dff	7	A	Everybody cares about the education the kids are getting
sw4784.dff	7	A	And they take an relatively active part
sw4784.dff	7	A	I mean if you're sending two thousand dollars that way every year you watch what goes on and you pay attention and participate and you can influence the way things are
sw4784.dff	8	B	So you're saying that the taxpayer who also is really paying through the pocketbook for the education of the child may not be quite so conscious of the fact that they are paying the tuition for that child in the form of real estate or other taxes and consequently they're not so motivated to get involved and make sure things happen the way they'd like to see them happen
sw4784.dff	9	A	The immediacy just isn't there
sw4784.dff	11	A	(And) (I) (also) (think) (that) (one) (of) (the) (problems) (and) (I) (think) (this) (is) (a) (cultural) (problem)
sw4784.dff	11	A	The problem with public education is really a problem with the culture
sw4784.dff	11	A	And I guess my evidence for that is the school districts in places like California for example where only a minority of the taxpayers have children in school and you can't get a tax levy passed
sw4784.dff	11	A	people are reluctant to pass school tax levies even when the money is needed or would be well spent because (they) (don't) (have) (kids) (in) (the) (schools)
sw4784.dff	13	A	I think that's a loss of civic virtue and a loss of the cultural attitude that we used to have that education was first even if it wasn't our kids
sw4784.dff	13	A	I think that's the principal problem is that people no longer see it as their problem (and) (there's) (an) (immediate) (problem)
sw4784.dff	14	B	It troubles me too that the priority seems to be with my particular purse strings rather than the public good and by definition for some of us at least the public good includes having an educated populace and then
sw4784.dff	16	B	idea that you can make a sound judgment with respect to small votes at the local level or bigger votes at
sw4784.dff	18	B	the national level
sw4784.dff	18	B	it means that you've got to be informed and you've got to have a certain level of education to do the reading
sw4784.dff	20	B	and the critical thinking involved to come up with a decision
sw4784.dff	21	A	I believe that the original idea of public education in the United States which I guess was controversial at the time of the constitution
sw4784.dff	21	A	it barely made it
sw4784.dff	21	A	I think it was added afterwards
sw4784.dff	21	A	I think the principal was education for civic participation
sw4784.dff	23	A	The idea was that everybody should have an education so that they would be a better voter and you couldn't pull the wool over their eyes
sw4784.dff	24	B	It has taken on a more profound and you'd think we'd notice it economic thrust
sw4784.dff	25	A	that's exactly what I was going to say
sw4784.dff	25	A	Now there seem to be really three reasons for education
sw4784.dff	25	A	One is education for civic duty
sw4784.dff	25	A	One is education for economic reasons
sw4784.dff	25	A	And one is education for civilization
sw4784.dff	25	A	(and) (I) (think) (that) (one)
sw4784.dff	26	B	I'm glad that you added that one
sw4784.dff	26	B	I think that one's significant
sw4784.dff	27	A	That's what I used to think education was all about when I was a college professor and then I quit and got disabused of that notion
sw4784.dff	27	A	But now the only thing people seem to agree on is that education is an economic enterprise to train people for jobs
sw4784.dff	27	A	And I'm not sure that people in the education establishment really know what their purpose is
sw4784.dff	27	A	And I'm really sad to say this I never thought I would have but I really think that the educational establishment has become part of the problem
sw4784.dff	27	A	And that's why (I) (guess) I'm sort of reluctantly in favor of these choice programs
sw4785.dff	1	B	kids too
sw4785.dff	3	B	you laugh
sw4785.dff	3	B	How many what ages
sw4785.dff	4	A	twenty-seven up
sw4785.dff	6	A	And we had five
sw4785.dff	7	B	You've been through the fun part
sw4785.dff	10	A	And how about yourself
sw4785.dff	11	B	I have a four and a half and a three
sw4785.dff	13	B	So
sw4785.dff	13	B	(It's) I'm sure there's a lot of differences in the way it's done now and then
sw4785.dff	14	A	when mine were growing up I did some traveling but not that extensively but I always just made it a point to spend about ten minutes with each one of them
sw4785.dff	16	A	So it was an hour
sw4785.dff	18	A	But whether it was going back and laying in bed with them and just shooting the breeze or whatever telling them stories or reading to them
sw4785.dff	19	B	What was the age difference between the youngest and the oldest
sw4785.dff	20	A	Six years
sw4785.dff	21	B	So they were all real close
sw4785.dff	23	B	That's tough
sw4785.dff	23	B	That's a lot of time
sw4785.dff	24	A	We look back and wonder how we did it
sw4785.dff	25	B	Did you both work
sw4785.dff	25	B	Your wife too
sw4785.dff	26	A	No she never did
sw4785.dff	27	B	(qualify) (that)
sw4785.dff	29	B	She worked at home I'm sure
sw4785.dff	31	B	(But) (that's) both my husband and I work and sometimes I feel like by the time I pick them up and get them home and get them fed I have very little time each evening
sw4785.dff	33	B	Maybe thirty minutes max
sw4785.dff	34	A	(that's) (plenty) (though)
sw4785.dff	35	B	And he spends a lot of time with them while I'm cooking and then I spend time with them while he's doing other stuff
sw4785.dff	35	B	and of course we try to spend a lot of time on the weekend
sw4785.dff	35	B	there's a lot of times my house may not be as clean as I particularly like it but it's neat it's straight and I can live with it because
sw4785.dff	37	B	I do stuff with my kids
sw4785.dff	38	A	with kids you're not going to have a neat house
sw4785.dff	39	B	I've accepted that too
sw4785.dff	40	A	(And)
sw4785.dff	41	B	That's true
sw4785.dff	42	A	it's tough to find time
sw4785.dff	43	B	(It) (is)
sw4785.dff	44	A	especially with both of them working
sw4785.dff	45	B	(That's) (true)
sw4785.dff	46	A	And you just have to set the time and say okay this is going to be it
sw4785.dff	47	B	that's true and we do a lot of that on the weekends We try to spend Saturdays together
sw4785.dff	49	B	If my husband golfs he'll do it during nap time things like that where they're not really missing the presence
sw4785.dff	51	B	and we do a lot of family things together
sw4785.dff	51	B	we're (kind) (of) going the other direction this weekend
sw4785.dff	51	B	We're planning a trip just he and I
sw4785.dff	51	B	This is the first time we've gone anywhere without the kids
sw4785.dff	52	A	(that's) (good) (too)
sw4785.dff	53	B	since she was born four and a half years ago
sw4785.dff	54	A	(that's) (good) (that) (way) (too)
sw4785.dff	55	B	I decided that you need that once in awhile
sw4785.dff	55	B	That (you) you need to plan the quality time and I do think that if you plan it and spend that and make it quality time you don't have to be there twenty-four hours a day
sw4785.dff	56	A	they say all it takes is about five ten minutes a day
sw4785.dff	58	A	(you) (know) and as the kids got older I made them help me cut the grass and
sw4785.dff	59	B	(Sure)
sw4785.dff	60	A	(kind) (of) made that a project too
sw4785.dff	61	B	(Sure)
sw4785.dff	62	A	(Or) (whatever) (and)
sw4785.dff	63	B	And they think that's a family activity
sw4785.dff	65	B	That's great fun
sw4785.dff	66	A	(And) (if)
sw4785.dff	67	B	My daughter's like Mommy can I help you with the laundry
sw4785.dff	67	B	Of course you can
sw4785.dff	68	A	Just keep them talking that way
sw4785.dff	69	B	(Absolutely)
sw4785.dff	70	A	But another thing we used to do is have family councils
sw4785.dff	72	A	Every Sunday night
sw4785.dff	73	B	And what would you do (what)
sw4785.dff	74	A	Discuss everything that didn't agree with them
sw4785.dff	74	A	And we'd take turns being president
sw4785.dff	76	A	And everyone would get one vote
sw4785.dff	76	A	And I always thought we'd get outvoted five to two
sw4785.dff	78	A	but it never worked that way
sw4785.dff	79	B	So they would just pick whatever issue (kind) (of) was at a
sw4785.dff	80	A	(and) (we) (could) (bring) (up)
sw4785.dff	81	B	head that week (and) (then)
sw4785.dff	82	A	and we could bring up stuff too
sw4785.dff	84	A	And that was always good time
sw4785.dff	84	A	we really got to know the kids well
sw4785.dff	85	B	(I) (imagine)
sw4785.dff	85	B	And I imagine you still have a very close relationship with them
sw4785.dff	86	A	In
sw4785.dff	87	B	(I)
sw4785.dff	88	A	fact they were all in over the weekend for Easter
sw4785.dff	89	B	(that's) (wonderful)
sw4785.dff	89	B	I was raised in that type of family where you don't disobey me you mind me but if you have a problem with what we did or how we did it you can always come back and talk to me about it
sw4785.dff	90	A	we did too
sw4785.dff	92	A	And I remember the one daughter saying we had a friend of hers that used to drive us up a tree
sw4785.dff	94	A	and she said I don't make fun of your friends so why make fun of mine
sw4785.dff	96	A	kind of hit us between the eyes
sw4785.dff	97	B	You don't think of it that way do you
sw4785.dff	98	A	No
sw4785.dff	98	A	But that was always (good) quality time for us
sw4785.dff	99	B	Now that's good
sw4785.dff	99	B	I like
sw4785.dff	100	A	(And) (then)
sw4785.dff	101	B	that idea
sw4785.dff	102	A	(never) (attend) (but) if they missed it they had to abide by the rules
sw4785.dff	103	B	Whatever was voted on
sw4785.dff	104	A	and (boy) they'd show up
sw4785.dff	105	B	I think that's great
sw4785.dff	106	A	(And) we'd usually take notes
sw4785.dff	108	A	and the younger kids or maybe all of them needed help at one time or another
sw4785.dff	110	A	but they were usually tougher on themselves than they were on us
sw4785.dff	110	A	And they loved it
sw4785.dff	111	B	I think that's true
sw4785.dff	111	B	I can remember times my parents would say what do you think would be a fair punishment
sw4785.dff	113	B	And we would always come up with something that was harder than what they would have done
sw4785.dff	115	B	(So) I (do) think (it's) that they're harder on themselves
sw4785.dff	116	A	But (boy) I feel for you and your husband
sw4785.dff	117	B	why is that
sw4785.dff	118	A	(two) (of) (my)
sw4788.dff	1	A	(I) (don't) (know)
sw4788.dff	1	A	Your camping experience is probably I don't know if they're similar to mine but since I've had children it has changed a little bit
sw4788.dff	3	A	but when my husband and I were camping we'd take this domed tent that is easily collapsible and go camping and just (kind) (of) roughed it
sw4788.dff	3	A	As long as there was a bathroom there and some clean showers and things like that then it was fine
sw4788.dff	3	A	But we'd get up at three in the morning and start on our little escapade for the day and (kind) (of) do a lot of different things and then stop when we wanted to
sw4788.dff	3	A	But that's (kind) (of) changed now
sw4788.dff	3	A	When you have a small child because they don't want to get up at three in the morning and you don't want them up that early
sw4788.dff	4	B	(Would) (you) (then) (go) hiking
sw4788.dff	4	B	would the camping be part of a long hike
sw4788.dff	5	A	We did a lot of different things
sw4788.dff	5	A	(We'd) (stop) (when) (we) (wanted) (to) (that) (kind) (of) (stuff)
sw4788.dff	5	A	So we (kind) (of) did a little bit of hiking and a little bit of sightseeing sitting back at different areas (and) (spending) (hours) we never had really a time limit we just kind of did what we wanted
sw4788.dff	7	A	to do for that day
sw4788.dff	7	A	Very comfortable (so)
sw4788.dff	8	B	(Were) (you) (up) (in) (Wisconsin) (or) (would) (you) (go) (into) (Can-) where would you camp
sw4788.dff	9	A	there's places in Wisconsin
sw4788.dff	9	A	There's the Apostle Islands
sw4788.dff	11	A	which are in Bayfield which is a wonderful place
sw4788.dff	11	A	And then there's also what we found in the state of South Dakota the Black Hills
sw4788.dff	12	B	That's beautiful
sw4788.dff	13	A	And we just have this really good time there
sw4788.dff	13	A	One thing is they don't have mosquitoes and sorry to say
sw4788.dff	15	A	in Wisconsin we do (so) (that) (kind) (of) (puts) (a) (little) (bit) (of) (a) (hamper) (on) (your) if you're going to go camping who wants to deal with bugs and
sw4788.dff	17	A	We found this one area that doesn't have mosquitoes
sw4788.dff	17	A	They just don't (have) (them) and it's just wonderful not to be bugged all night long with a humming mosquito at your ear (so)
sw4788.dff	18	B	most of my camping I haven't done much since I was a kid
sw4788.dff	20	B	but we'd basically take the tent up in the Sierras and usually just camp near some stream
sw4788.dff	22	B	or some lake
sw4788.dff	23	A	(Sure)
sw4788.dff	24	B	And just it wasn't even a full tent
sw4788.dff	24	B	It would be more a tarp
sw4788.dff	25	A	(Sure)
sw4788.dff	26	B	strung up between trees and my dad would take four kids
sw4788.dff	28	B	My brother and myself and two cousins
sw4788.dff	29	A	(Sure)
sw4788.dff	30	B	and we just thought it was absolute heaven
sw4788.dff	32	B	there was certainly nothing like a bathroom a shower or anything
sw4788.dff	34	B	near by
sw4788.dff	34	B	It was dig your own hole (and)
sw4788.dff	35	A	That was really called roughing it
sw4788.dff	36	B	(and) (I)
sw4788.dff	37	A	(I)
sw4788.dff	38	B	I'm not sure I'd do (that)
sw4788.dff	39	A	(Anymore)
sw4788.dff	40	B	that anymore but it's it actually some friends of mine and I are planning to camp this summer for four days
sw4788.dff	40	B	(Also)
sw4788.dff	41	A	(Sure)
sw4788.dff	42	B	going fishing
sw4788.dff	44	B	and I have a idea it's going to be a lot more equipment and a lot more stuff than
sw4788.dff	45	A	(Than) (you) (sure)
sw4788.dff	46	B	before
sw4788.dff	47	A	Than when you were younger
sw4788.dff	48	B	(But)
sw4788.dff	49	A	(it) with kids they don't care if they take a shower everyday
sw4788.dff	49	A	(With) (kids) they don't care about a lot of things
sw4788.dff	49	A	But as adults it's like if I don't take a shower every day (I) (feel) (like)
sw4788.dff	51	A	I just don't feel so
sw4788.dff	51	A	There's lots of places if you're going to go camping
sw4788.dff	51	A	K O A -s are wonderful
sw4788.dff	51	A	it's kind of the yuppie type of camping because they have showers they have things for kids to do
sw4788.dff	51	A	They have swimming pools things like that
sw4788.dff	51	A	If you
sw4788.dff	52	B	(my)
sw4788.dff	53	A	can find some really nice clean campgrounds versus if you go to state parks we have found state parks not that they're lacking but they're certainly not up to a standard of a K O A where it's a little bit cleaner
sw4788.dff	53	A	(You've) (got) (the) (showers) (available)
sw4788.dff	53	A	It's not in the same category
sw4788.dff	53	A	State parks you get a little bit fearful too things like that simply because they are supposed to be patrolled but it's a little bit different
sw4788.dff	53	A	so we've always kind of stayed with a K O A and then did other things besides just sit at the campground at night
sw4788.dff	53	A	That's the only time you really use your campground
sw4788.dff	53	A	If you're going to be gone all day long walking someplace or doing tourism or whatever
sw4792.dff	1	A	I'm Nevin from Sunnyvale California
sw4792.dff	2	B	Hi this is Jim Bliss from Minneapolis Minnesota
sw4792.dff	2	B	How you doing
sw4792.dff	3	A	Pretty good
sw4792.dff	4	B	(Good)
sw4792.dff	4	B	I guess the topic is trial by jury and
sw4792.dff	6	B	how we should change that or how we would change it
sw4792.dff	6	B	I'm ready whenever you are
sw4792.dff	7	A	(Okay)
sw4792.dff	8	B	what are your thoughts on the subject there
sw4792.dff	9	A	I definitely think decisions have to be unanimous
sw4792.dff	10	B	I think that's probably a good thing
sw4792.dff	11	A	It's probably the safest thing
sw4792.dff	12	B	it's to easy to get a quorum
sw4792.dff	14	B	and simple majority won't do
sw4792.dff	15	A	No
sw4792.dff	15	A	And even two-thirds majority (it's)
sw4792.dff	16	B	(that's) quorums are to easy to get
sw4792.dff	18	B	And there's always that chance that one or two people could be playing devil's advocate for a good reason
sw4792.dff	20	B	(So) (it's)
sw4792.dff	22	B	(definitely) but I don't know
sw4792.dff	22	B	I couldn't believe they suggested that judges should be doing the sentencing
sw4792.dff	23	A	Gives them a little too much power
sw4792.dff	24	B	(Tha-) I know of a couple of people at least who would be arguing with that
sw4792.dff	24	B	Or arguing against that pretty vehemently
sw4792.dff	24	B	(But)
sw4792.dff	25	A	Plus you may be doing a guilty verdict but you know it may be for technical reasons
sw4792.dff	26	B	About the only good thing I would say about that is that it would hurry the process up a bit
sw4792.dff	28	B	but even now I know we've got plenty of cases out there where people have been wrongly convicted and things like that (and)
sw4792.dff	29	A	(I) (know)
sw4792.dff	30	B	that's what the trial by jury
sw4792.dff	30	B	(jeez) if the judge was doing it himself without any checks and balances
sw4792.dff	32	B	whose to say
sw4792.dff	33	A	(It) there would be much more of that
sw4792.dff	34	B	(no) (doubt)
sw4792.dff	34	B	Are you involved in the legal system at all
sw4792.dff	35	A	(No)
sw4792.dff	35	A	(But) (I) ()
sw4792.dff	36	B	(Okay)
sw4792.dff	37	A	(I) tend to follow it (just) (to) just to know what's going on
sw4792.dff	38	B	I've got some friends that are lawyers (so)
sw4792.dff	39	A	I do too (so)
sw4792.dff	40	B	One of them just got his law degree
sw4792.dff	40	B	But to tell you the truth I'm not real familiar with the system of jurisprudence the way it is now
sw4792.dff	41	A	(No)
sw4792.dff	42	B	I really haven't studied it in depth
sw4792.dff	43	A	I know a little more about civil cases than criminal cases
sw4792.dff	45	A	(Which) (is) (it's) more in how you present it (versus) (who's)
sw4792.dff	46	B	(I'm) (sure) (of) (it)
sw4792.dff	46	B	Because a lot of those things it's largely a matter of viewpoint
sw4792.dff	48	B	And who can argue their case better
sw4792.dff	50	B	it's kind of weird
sw4792.dff	50	B	(I) (don't) (know) I always think about watching the PEOPLE'S COURT or something
sw4792.dff	52	B	And how weird those cases get
sw4792.dff	53	A	(I) (know)
sw4792.dff	54	B	(It's) (just)
sw4792.dff	55	A	(When) (I) (was) (a) (couple) (of) (years) (ago) (involved) (in) (some) (pretrial) (stuff) (and)
sw4792.dff	57	A	you say okay we can't bring up this point because then (they're) (going) (to) the opposition will say this (this) (and) (this) (and)
sw4792.dff	58	B	(And) (it's) (like) (boy) the stuff that they can twist around
sw4792.dff	60	B	is (it's) pretty amazing
sw4792.dff	61	A	And it's like the truth isn't really important anymore
sw4792.dff	61	A	(It's)
sw4792.dff	62	B	(it's) (not)
sw4792.dff	62	B	And then you get people who bring in cases just because they want to bring them up just because
sw4792.dff	64	B	this friend of mine's pretty obnoxious and he really gets into suing people
sw4792.dff	66	B	And so he'll sue just about anybody just for the chance to get into court
sw4792.dff	68	B	and argue his case (it's) (like)
sw4792.dff	69	A	That sounds like a little abuse of our system (but)
sw4792.dff	70	B	(It) (is)
sw4792.dff	70	B	(It's) (it's) wasting people's time and the taxpayers' money and everything else
sw4792.dff	70	B	(But)
sw4792.dff	71	A	(but) (it's) (for) (the) (more) (general) people don't want to take responsibility
sw4792.dff	73	A	(it's)
sw4792.dff	74	B	and most of the time they're looking to place blame
sw4792.dff	76	B	(and) (stuff)
sw4792.dff	76	B	you're from California (is) (that)
sw4792.dff	77	A	originally from Chicago (but)
sw4792.dff	78	B	(okay)
sw4792.dff	78	B	I was just thinking I wonder how the civil system or the court system must differ between there and where I am in Minneapolis
sw4792.dff	79	A	(I) (really)
sw4792.dff	80	B	From what I understand it's all pretty the same except when you get to Louisiana
sw4792.dff	82	B	And Louisiana is completely different cause (it) (was) (based) (on) (the) (what) (is) (it) it's based on common law and
sw4792.dff	84	B	the rest of the country is not or something like that
sw4792.dff	86	B	Pretty strange
sw4792.dff	86	B	But fortunately I never have had to go in
sw4792.dff	87	A	I haven't either (other) (than)
sw4792.dff	88	B	even for jury duty
sw4792.dff	88	B	But that friend of mine's telling me that I might have to go in as a witness
sw4792.dff	88	B	He may subpoena me
sw4792.dff	90	B	So we'll see what happens
sw4792.dff	90	B	(But)
sw4792.dff	91	A	I'm not really sure how we could change the legal system to make it better
sw4792.dff	92	B	(It's) there are too many big problems there's such a backlog of court cases now
sw4792.dff	93	A	I know
sw4792.dff	94	B	to try to get them all in a good time and we already have too many lawyers as it is
sw4792.dff	95	A	And if it's criminal cases you can't put them in jail because there's no room left
sw4792.dff	96	B	that's true
sw4792.dff	96	B	(And) (in) (fact) they're even letting some go
sw4792.dff	98	B	I'm originally from Florida and it's like
sw4792.dff	100	B	it seems like every year they let out more and more just cause they don't have room for them (That's) (not) (a) that's not a good solution either
sw4792.dff	101	A	Not at all
sw4792.dff	102	B	(I'm) (not) (real) (sure) (what) (the)
sw4796.dff	1	A	Okay Randall do you have any special interest in space flight
sw4796.dff	2	B	Ever since I was a young and used to watch the old Apollo missions going off in classroom T V -s
sw4796.dff	4	B	I suspect a lot of people got turned on by watching those (go) (off)
sw4796.dff	6	B	very exciting
sw4796.dff	8	B	(The) I've always wanted very much to be somehow involved in all that
sw4796.dff	10	B	And to meet and to see it actually happen
sw4796.dff	10	B	Of course I've really wanted to actually manage to get into space someday
sw4796.dff	12	B	But that seems rather unlikely at this point unfortunately
sw4796.dff	13	A	What do you do now
sw4796.dff	14	B	computer programmer
sw4796.dff	16	B	Unfortunately that can be done from the ground
sw4796.dff	17	A	(To) (bad)
sw4796.dff	18	B	Made the wrong career choice to get up into space
sw4796.dff	20	B	(The) I used to think when I was younger that by this time we'd have lots more stuff in space than we do now
sw4796.dff	22	B	frustrating at times
sw4796.dff	24	B	I don't know what you think about all that
sw4796.dff	25	A	I'm (kind) (of) young
sw4796.dff	25	A	I'm only twenty-two (and) (so) (I'm) (not) there's a lot that's happened in my lifetime as far as with the space shuttle and all
sw4796.dff	25	A	Although plans to go to other planets have somewhat been thwarted in comparison to the sixties
sw4796.dff	27	A	although (I) (have) (a) (I) (kind) (of) wonder if it were possible to market some form of space technology to make it equitable it might severely help the economy in the respect that there's endless amounts of research to be done
sw4796.dff	27	A	Endless amounts of resources and
sw4796.dff	29	A	and whatnot it would be great
sw4796.dff	31	A	if we could find some way to use that to boost the economy
sw4796.dff	32	B	(the) I've always felt that one of the long-term solutions (that) (at) (least) (a) (few) (of) (our) (problems) would be to have some sort of solar power satellites up
sw4796.dff	34	B	because that's a singularly renewable resource that doesn't require any particularly nasty environment impact
sw4796.dff	35	A	Exactly
sw4796.dff	36	B	And you can just get as much power as you need up there
sw4796.dff	38	B	It's just a matter of how big you build it
sw4796.dff	40	B	and of course the side effects of this is that you have to have lunar mining bases and space stations and easy transport into space and no things that I think we should be doing
sw4796.dff	40	B	So the side effects of doing that which I think would be (good) very very good for everyone in the long run is some of the other things I'd like to see happen (would) (happen) (also) (so) (I'm)
sw4796.dff	41	A	(It) (seems) (like) (there's) so you're talking about positive side effects then
sw4796.dff	43	A	Okay I understand
sw4796.dff	45	A	Sure that makes a lot of sense
sw4796.dff	46	B	The only problem is of course (that) that requires significant commitment
sw4796.dff	48	B	from people to actually decide they want to put things like that up there
sw4796.dff	50	B	And they want to do the research (and)
sw4796.dff	52	B	(they're) (all) (nor-) the only commitments that they're interested in making or even talking about are ones for flash value like the trip to Mars
sw4796.dff	53	A	(exactly)
sw4796.dff	54	B	Which would produce some useful scientific research and so forth but the same money could probably be far better spent on lunar bases and solar power satellite research and so forth
sw4796.dff	56	B	it would be being done for the glitz and show factor
sw4796.dff	58	B	to get politician votes instead of for we should eventually send people to Mars but not just because it's glitzy to do so
sw4796.dff	60	B	We should do it for the return we get for it
sw4796.dff	62	B	And unfortunately that's not what I thinks happened
sw4799.dff	14	B	(And) he just kind of became a vegetable and died
sw4799.dff	15	A	no
sw4799.dff	16	B	(So)
sw4799.dff	17	A	(That's) (sad)
sw4799.dff	18	B	but that was a long time ago
sw4799.dff	20	B	That was back in like seventy-three
sw4799.dff	21	A	(okay)
sw4799.dff	22	B	(So) I think the way they did things were a lot different back then
sw4799.dff	23	A	(I'm) (sure) (they) (were)
sw4799.dff	24	B	(And) my grandmother his wife
sw4799.dff	26	B	we also put her in a rest home
sw4799.dff	26	B	She was in a rest home and then she was back out because she didn't really need to be there and physical had a good physical therapist at that place and
sw4799.dff	28	B	they worked with her and got her walking and got her kind of taking care of herself and so
sw4799.dff	30	B	she was able to come back home and
sw4799.dff	32	B	then she had to go back in a couple of times but mostly it was just because she kind of gave up
sw4799.dff	34	B	And they got her going again
sw4799.dff	36	B	So I guess as far I said as what you're looking for I think you need to look for an interactive staff
sw4799.dff	38	B	Somebody who is willing to you know work with patients and do
sw4799.dff	40	B	do things with them and treat them (treat) (like) (they're)
sw4799.dff	41	A	And I'm sure it's expensive
sw4799.dff	42	B	(it) (is)
sw4799.dff	44	B	(It) (is) (expensive)
sw4799.dff	45	A	my grandmother is not in a nursing home but she's in a
sw4799.dff	47	A	they're apartments for senior citizens
sw4799.dff	49	A	and she loves that because they arrange activities for them all day long
sw4799.dff	51	A	and then they have where the bus picks them up and takes them where they need to go and she really does love that but she's just concerned about in the future
sw4799.dff	53	A	That she knows it's not going to be like that all the time
sw4799.dff	53	A	(And) (she's) (just) (wondering)
sw4799.dff	54	B	When she can't take care of herself
sw4799.dff	55	A	(what's) (going) (to) (happen) (to) (me) (and) (I) (I) (guess) it's (so) normal to start (to) (wonder) (about) (that) (even) (if) (she) (doesn't) (need) (that) (but)
sw4799.dff	59	A	(she's) (kind) (of) asking questions about (well) what's going to happen this can't last forever (and) (so)
sw4799.dff	60	B	Does she have a (is) (it) (like) a kitchenette type apartment where she can fix her own food if she wants to
sw4799.dff	62	B	or she can go down to the cafeteria
sw4799.dff	63	A	she can but (I) (think) it is also cafeteria style
sw4799.dff	63	A	(Because) I doubt (if) she (rarely) cooks for herself
sw4799.dff	65	A	(So)
sw4799.dff	66	B	(In) (fact) (I) ()
sw4799.dff	67	A	because I remember her in her letters telling me she'll go downstairs for coffee or something to eat so I'm assuming it's something like that (too)
sw4799.dff	69	A	(So)
sw4799.dff	70	B	I really like that concept
sw4799.dff	72	B	they have well quite a few of those places like that here in Utah and (couples) (can) husband and wife can live there too (or) (whatever)
sw4799.dff	72	B	(I) and yet they have their friendships and relationships (you) (know) of getting together and eating together (and) (all) (of) (that)
sw4799.dff	74	B	(I) (think) it really takes looking more at the people than even really the facilities
sw4799.dff	75	A	And she lives by herself too
sw4799.dff	75	A	She seems to like it
sw4799.dff	77	A	And my husband's grandmother is she lives in a house on her own and she doesn't really need the care or anything like that but she has her own home and she's doing really well
sw4799.dff	77	A	I'm really proud of her
sw4799.dff	77	A	She's doing really well so we haven't had to do anything but then again she has a lot of support (so)
sw4801.dff	20	B	I don't know
sw4801.dff	20	B	In some ways I don't like it because it's like they're playing God
sw4801.dff	22	B	(And) (that's) (not) (I) (don't) (think) (that's) But on the other hand there's a lot of advantages to it
sw4801.dff	24	B	I think crime rates deterred a little bit by using it and of course you have some savings in terms of taxpayer money keeping people in jail or not
sw4801.dff	26	B	with Florida that's a big problem because there's so many people in jail that they have to let them out every year
sw4801.dff	26	B	(They)
sw4801.dff	27	A	That's what's happening here
sw4801.dff	27	A	(There) (is) that's in fact a big gubernatorial issue is the
sw4801.dff	29	A	the turnover rates of r- repeat offenders being let out and doing it again
sw4801.dff	30	B	Sure
sw4801.dff	30	B	And like you know that's a big problem but there's not a whole lot you can do about it because there's only so many jails you can build
sw4801.dff	32	B	and it gets to be a big problem
sw4801.dff	34	B	(go) (ahead)
sw4801.dff	35	A	I wish if they were going to do it they would be a little more consistent in dealing with who gets lethal injection and who doesn't
sw4801.dff	37	A	(Be) (a) (little) (more) not being able to put it off for fifteen years
sw4801.dff	38	B	Because a lot of these guys they get in and they get off for good behavior and (I) (don't) (know) up in Minnesota where I am now they don't have the death penalty
sw4801.dff	38	B	And you can almost sense that people are just laughing at the system Because they figure sure I get thirty or forty years for maybe rape or something
sw4801.dff	38	B	but then (for) if I elicit good behavior I'm out in maybe five or ten
sw4801.dff	39	A	(really)
sw4801.dff	40	B	(sure)
sw4801.dff	41	A	(Goodness)
sw4801.dff	42	B	just because (like) (we) (said) (before) they don't have enough room in the jails
sw4801.dff	44	B	there's a lot of incentive for them to be let out early
sw4801.dff	46	B	But if you've got the death penalty hanging over your head (I) (don't) (know) (I) (think) that may solve a lot of that
sw4801.dff	48	B	(Maybe) (not) (solve) (it) (but) (I) (don't) (know) (maybe) ()
sw4801.dff	49	A	I tend to think the repeal system for the death penalty is a little too lenient
sw4801.dff	51	A	kind of takes away from the significance (of) (the) (death) (penalty)
sw4801.dff	52	B	What do you do Georgeanne
sw4801.dff	53	A	I'm a graduate student at the University of Texas in Dallas
sw4801.dff	54	B	(okay)
sw4801.dff	54	B	(Great)
sw4801.dff	54	B	What program you in
sw4801.dff	55	A	audiology
sw4801.dff	56	B	(Okay)
sw4801.dff	56	B	(Fantastic)
sw4801.dff	57	A	What do you do
sw4801.dff	58	B	I'm a doctoral student at the University of Central Florida
sw4801.dff	59	A	(really)
sw4801.dff	60	B	I'm doing an internship up at Honeywell
sw4801.dff	61	A	(really)
sw4801.dff	63	A	(Neat)
sw4801.dff	64	B	(But) (I) (don't) (know)
sw4801.dff	64	B	it's an interesting issue
sw4801.dff	64	B	(like) (you) (say) in Texas there's been quite a few and in Florida in the last few years I think there's been a lot
sw4801.dff	64	B	(you) (know) I can't give you figures (but)
sw4801.dff	65	A	(I) (just) this was in conjunction with the guy that was put in the gas chamber in California
sw4801.dff	67	A	So (I) (think) (it) the forty-sixth in the last twenty-five years I (think) (is) (what)
sw4801.dff	68	B	(is) (that)
sw4801.dff	69	A	(they) (gave) (a) (run) (down) (that) (Texas)
sw4801.dff	70	B	(Okay)
sw4801.dff	71	A	Texas tends to be a little more robust and disciplined (area) (then)
sw4801.dff	72	B	(I) (kind) (of) I've heard things about that
sw4801.dff	72	B	(I've) (heard) (that) they don't mess around very much
sw4801.dff	75	A	they don't get repealed as easily as they do
sw4801.dff	77	A	the guy in California (got) (thir-) (twice) (before) he went to the gas chamber and then they said no you don't have to go
sw4801.dff	77	A	And then they took him back
sw4801.dff	77	A	(it) (just) (seems)
sw4801.dff	78	B	(Jeez) that's a lot of repeals
sw4801.dff	79	A	it just seemed a little inconsistent
sw4801.dff	79	A	And then (you) (have) (two) you have these people who are serial killers that didn't even get the death sentence (back) (when)
sw4801.dff	81	A	ever
sw4801.dff	82	B	I don't know
sw4801.dff	82	B	I'm trying to think about other crimes that would warrant it
sw4801.dff	82	B	I guess what's the policy now with treason
sw4801.dff	82	B	do they axe you for treason or is it a life sentence
sw4801.dff	83	A	No I don't think the military doesn't execute anymore so
sw4801.dff	85	A	Or death before the firing squad or whatever
sw4801.dff	87	A	So I think about the only one is rape
sw4802.dff	1	A	Okay
sw4802.dff	1	A	read any good books lately
sw4802.dff	2	B	yes I've read several good books lately
sw4802.dff	2	B	lot of them related to business and financial matters since that's what I do for a living
sw4802.dff	3	A	(okay)
sw4802.dff	4	B	How about yourself
sw4802.dff	5	A	I'm in graduate school and so I read a lot of books but I don't know if I consider very many of them good
sw4802.dff	7	A	I haven't read a book for enjoyment since (I) (guess) around Christmas
sw4802.dff	7	A	I received several books for Christmas and at Christmas break I read SARUM by a fellow named Rutherford
sw4802.dff	8	B	(Yes)
sw4802.dff	9	A	(it's) (the) (history) (of) it's sort of the historical fiction about the Salisbury area in England
sw4802.dff	11	A	And so I really enjoyed that book a lot
sw4802.dff	11	A	he's not quite as good as Michener or some of the other historical writers
sw4802.dff	11	A	But he did this job well (so)
sw4802.dff	12	B	(that) (sounds) (good)
sw4802.dff	13	A	do you find you have much chance to read for just pleasure or mostly for business
sw4802.dff	14	B	No I read for pleasure some also
sw4802.dff	14	B	I read a book recently called IRON JOHN
sw4802.dff	16	B	Have you seen that by Bly
sw4802.dff	17	A	I don't think I have seen it
sw4802.dff	18	B	(Okay)
sw4802.dff	18	B	it's a book about
sw4802.dff	20	B	Greek gods and (and) (Greek) mythology
sw4802.dff	22	B	as well as man and interacting with other men (and) (a) (book) (about) (men) and how they mature through life
sw4802.dff	24	B	(And) how they deal with life itself
sw4802.dff	25	A	Okay
sw4802.dff	25	A	I think I have heard about that
sw4802.dff	26	B	But it's all revolved around mythology
sw4802.dff	28	B	as far as traditions from other cultures and our culture
sw4802.dff	30	B	And how we interact with one another
sw4802.dff	31	A	that sounds great
sw4802.dff	31	A	did it have something to mention about (sort) (of) cultural rituals of manhood
sw4802.dff	32	B	Yes
sw4802.dff	33	A	Okay
sw4802.dff	33	A	I have heard of that
sw4802.dff	33	A	I have someone suggested that I read it
sw4802.dff	33	A	Is it IRON JOHN
sw4802.dff	34	B	Yes
sw4802.dff	35	A	(Okay)
sw4802.dff	35	A	(Good)
sw4802.dff	36	B	By Bly B L Y I believe it is
sw4802.dff	37	A	(B) (L) (Y)
sw4802.dff	39	A	(Okay)
sw4802.dff	39	A	(Great)
sw4802.dff	40	B	And it's a very interesting book
sw4802.dff	41	A	(what) (are) (your) (favorite) do you have a favorite subject to read whether it be science fiction or history (or)
sw4802.dff	42	B	it depends again (if) (we're) (talking) (about) I read a lot of religious books
sw4802.dff	44	B	just because I have an interest in that area
sw4802.dff	46	B	And I read a lot of books in the area of psychology and self-help type materials
sw4802.dff	47	A	(Okay)
sw4802.dff	48	B	always trying to understand people
sw4802.dff	50	B	better and understand myself in relation to other people and try to understand where the people are coming from because I'm in a people business
sw4802.dff	51	A	(Okay)
sw4802.dff	52	B	(so) (that's) my work is my hobby
sw4802.dff	53	A	(That)
sw4802.dff	54	B	So I enjoy it
sw4802.dff	55	A	(sounds) (great)
sw4802.dff	55	A	whose your favorite religious author
sw4802.dff	56	B	I don't know if I have a favorite
sw4802.dff	58	B	religious author
sw4802.dff	58	B	I would have to say that some (of) (the) (ones) (that) (consistently) (put) (out) (good) (materials)
sw4802.dff	60	B	that's difficult because one person might write one book extremely well and some other ones might not write as well
sw4802.dff	62	B	(I) (had) (to) (stop) (here) (and) (think) (a) (second)
sw4802.dff	62	B	One of the ones that I've read recently that I've read several of his books and I thought that each one of his books were good
sw4802.dff	62	B	He's the man out of San Antonio
sw4802.dff	62	B	(And)
sw4802.dff	63	A	Max Lucado
sw4802.dff	64	B	(Max) (Lucado)
sw4802.dff	66	B	Max consistently writes good books
sw4802.dff	67	A	he's a great man
sw4802.dff	67	A	I've met him several times
sw4802.dff	68	B	Yes
sw4802.dff	68	B	I know him
sw4802.dff	70	B	But
sw4802.dff	72	B	there's other authors also that write good books from time to time but not consistently put out the materials all the time
sw4802.dff	74	B	I'd say another which is a local writer here in Plano (is) (I'm) (trying) (to) (think) (of) (his) (name)
sw4802.dff	74	B	He's with the Bible church
sw4802.dff	74	B	(And) (that) (is) (I) (see) (his) (name) (but) (I) (can't) (I) (see) (him) (but) (I) (can't) (see) (his) (name)
sw4802.dff	74	B	But he talks about a lot of different topics and
sw4812.dff	28	B	electrical engineering
sw4812.dff	29	A	(okay)
sw4812.dff	29	A	(Great)
sw4812.dff	29	A	I'm a graduate student at U C F in Florida
sw4812.dff	29	A	University of Central Florida
sw4812.dff	30	B	(wow)
sw4812.dff	31	A	And this is actually a an internship up here
sw4812.dff	33	A	But even for interns they do the whole random drug (or) (the) (whole) (drug) testing thing (so)
sw4812.dff	34	B	They test you before you start or before you even
sw4812.dff	36	B	interview (or)
sw4812.dff	37	A	(they) (essentially) (no) (I) (sure) (don't) they essentially made me the offer and then did the drug testing thing after that
sw4812.dff	37	A	So it was one of those things where you go through the general battery of all their tests and then they essentially give you the offer
sw4812.dff	39	A	and then at that point they'll ask you to go to a drug testing and things like that
sw4812.dff	41	A	(So) (there's) (some) (noise) (on) (this) (end)
sw4812.dff	41	A	(I'm) (actually) (in) (a) (mall) (calling) (so)
sw4812.dff	43	A	(You) (probably) (wondered) (But)
sw4812.dff	44	B	what happens if you were to fail
sw4812.dff	44	B	Then do they give you one more chance or two more chances
sw4812.dff	45	A	(Yes)
sw4812.dff	45	A	(That's) (a) (good) (question)
sw4812.dff	45	A	I believe from what I remember of the literature they gave if you fail I believe they give you one more chance
sw4812.dff	45	A	They probably give you a chance to explain yourself
sw4812.dff	47	A	and then maybe give you another chance to go through it
sw4812.dff	47	A	But once again those things are not that accurate so there's undoubtedly a proportion of people who do fail (But) (wha-) (are) (you) (working) (now) (anywhere) (or)
sw4812.dff	48	B	no
sw4812.dff	49	A	(Okay)
sw4812.dff	50	B	I'm just about to finish my Master's in May (and)
sw4812.dff	51	A	(okay)
sw4812.dff	51	A	(Great)
sw4812.dff	52	B	just interviewing with companies now
sw4812.dff	53	A	That was the first time I'd ever gotten any kind of drug screening (was) going to Honeywell
sw4812.dff	53	A	A friend of mine is also a doctoral student down there
sw4812.dff	55	A	And he's doing an internship with I B M
sw4812.dff	57	A	And they basically did the same exact thing
sw4812.dff	57	A	we both got our internships at the same time and we both had to go through drug testing at the same time
sw4812.dff	57	A	So one of those things where we went through a kind of an identical process
sw4812.dff	57	A	(But)
sw4812.dff	58	B	do they test you now at work too
sw4812.dff	59	A	No no
sw4812.dff	59	A	(That's)
sw4812.dff	60	B	(Okay)
sw4812.dff	61	A	one thing they don't do is drug testing while you're on the job
sw4812.dff	61	A	I think the unwritten rule is expect it but they don't do it
sw4812.dff	63	A	(so)
sw4812.dff	63	A	That's good I guess
sw4812.dff	63	A	(I) (don't) (know)
sw4812.dff	63	A	I have gone to a couple of parties since that time and while I don't do any drugs myself I've seen some people who work there smoking a joint or whatever
sw4812.dff	65	A	And that's the kind of thing that would definitely come up But no they don't really do that
sw4812.dff	65	A	(So)
sw4814.dff	1	B	interesting political trends or events
sw4814.dff	3	B	(I) (guess) the most interesting one (that's) going on now from my perspective is this phenomena of Ross Perot
sw4814.dff	3	B	caught his interview last night with David Frost and it was
sw4814.dff	5	B	the first time I had heard his views expressed by himself
sw4814.dff	5	B	I had heard other people talk about what they thought he believed in
sw4814.dff	7	B	But the whole phenomena of him coming out of literally nowhere and no party
sw4814.dff	7	B	at least no apparent party support on either side is
sw4814.dff	9	B	pretty interesting
sw4814.dff	10	A	I have not even heard (believe) (it) (or) (not) of that person
sw4814.dff	12	A	I'm not kidding
sw4814.dff	12	A	when you said it it was kind of like a surprise
sw4814.dff	13	B	Like out of nowhere
sw4814.dff	14	A	I think mainly because I haven't been watching what's politically going on
sw4814.dff	16	A	(you) (know) in that aspect
sw4814.dff	16	A	(I) (as) (far) (as) (now) the new house bill that went to Minnesota being that it is their neighboring state and that I lived in Minnesota I'm more familiar with the politics (that) involved with that (and) that being passed
sw4814.dff	18	A	But as far as politics in the grander part of it (as) (if) (you) (want) (to) (look) (at) election type things I'm not quite sure even if I'm going to vote
sw4814.dff	20	A	it gets harder and harder each time an election comes up (like) (that) to make the decision on who would be the best to run
sw4814.dff	21	B	it seems that the decision so far has been filtered
sw4814.dff	23	B	by party politics so much that
sw4814.dff	24	A	(Sure)
sw4814.dff	25	B	when the candidates finally get party approval party support and therefore get presented to the public the
sw4814.dff	26	A	(Exactly)
sw4814.dff	27	B	candidates are already beyond what most public feels is acceptable behavior
sw4814.dff	29	B	one of the common criticisms of Clinton is (gee) he'll say or do anything in order to get to the White House
sw4814.dff	30	A	(Sure)
sw4814.dff	31	B	and up and to the point of Perot being a serious candidate it seems like that was a requirement of being a contender within the party is to have done all those things
sw4814.dff	32	A	(Sure)
sw4814.dff	33	B	here's a guy who for twenty years has been working toward getting the party nomination and preparing himself for the presidency and now it seems like both he and the incumbent President are pretty seriously threatened by somebody who comes out of a whole nonpolitical arena
sw4814.dff	34	A	He might be one of those (sure)
sw4814.dff	34	A	(it's) (kind) (of) when you think back of the old politics where a dirt farmer when you think of some of the best presidents we've had in the past have been people that have struggled to get to the top
sw4814.dff	34	A	they were not rich in
sw4814.dff	36	A	in any means and it has been kind of in the past (I) (don't) (know) (maybe) fifty years that in order for a person to get involved with politics they've had to have money
sw4814.dff	38	A	And you had to have the views of the people that were going to be paying your way
sw4814.dff	40	A	so it makes the common person not to say that a common person couldn't run for government and do a fabulous job because he's got people that are quite intelligent and I don't know if we'll ever see that Where a common person could ever get in there that has good moral standings and has you think of Abraham Lincoln and just the background of
sw4814.dff	42	A	Abraham Lincoln
sw4814.dff	42	A	teaching himself to read
sw4814.dff	42	A	He didn't go to college
sw4814.dff	42	A	He didn't do all the other things that you would think that was real popular to do and to get politically involved in and have money
sw4814.dff	42	A	He didn't come
sw4814.dff	44	A	from money
sw4814.dff	44	A	(and) (now) (it's)
sw4814.dff	45	B	and yet even he was a consummate politician in the sense that not only did he fail in business twice with bankruptcy and failure
sw4821.dff	1	A	(Okay)
sw4821.dff	1	A	(let) (me) (see)
sw4821.dff	1	A	I've been sitting here awhile
sw4821.dff	1	A	I almost forgot the topic
sw4821.dff	1	A	But it seems like I get most of my news from television
sw4821.dff	1	A	we only get the paper on the weekends and so I'm not much of a paper reader and I rarely listen to the radio so I get most of my news from documentaries like FORTY-EIGHT HOURS TWENTY TWENTY the news at night
sw4821.dff	3	A	News in the afternoon (that) (kind) (of) (thing)
sw4821.dff	4	B	I get a
sw4821.dff	6	B	weekend paper as well and in addition to that I get a local weekly
sw4821.dff	6	B	I live in suburb of Milwaukee
sw4821.dff	8	B	and they have community newspapers around here so their extremely local stuff
sw4821.dff	10	B	is in the local paper that comes out once a week and then I get the Sunday MILWAUKEE JOURNAL because I don't have time to read a paper
sw4821.dff	10	B	mostly
sw4821.dff	12	B	that's my difficulty
sw4821.dff	12	B	I get my news (pretty) much from the same sources as you do although I do listen to N P R (which) (has) (very) (good) and that's National Public Radio which
sw4821.dff	14	B	has very good coverage of the national and international news (I) (feel)
sw4821.dff	16	B	and does a (pretty) good job of analysis as well
sw4821.dff	17	A	Are you in the car quite a bit (or)
sw4821.dff	18	B	No I'm not actually
sw4821.dff	18	B	but I can run my radio in my office
sw4821.dff	18	B	I
sw4821.dff	20	B	teach at the university and when I'm not
sw4821.dff	22	B	teaching if I choose to have the radio on I can listen to that station so
sw4821.dff	23	A	(I) (see)
sw4821.dff	24	B	are you satisfied with the TWENTY TWENTY and FORTY-EIGHT HOURS and the things that you do watch
sw4821.dff	25	A	I (pretty) (much) am and I watch the news at least twice a day
sw4821.dff	27	A	So if I've missed something and I've (just) recently decided to stay home with my children and so it seems as if I catch the news as it happens
sw4821.dff	29	A	There was the explosions (and) (that) (kind) (of) (thing)
sw4821.dff	29	A	My husband will say how did you know about that
sw4821.dff	29	A	Yes it happened at such and such time
sw4821.dff	29	A	And that's different for me
sw4821.dff	29	A	So I usually find out exactly when it happens (and) (that) (kind) (of) (thing)
sw4821.dff	30	B	Is that the aspect of the news that you're most interested in is the timely noting of the events as they happen
sw4821.dff	30	B	Is that what you feel good about in the news coverage
sw4821.dff	31	A	no it just seems like since I've recently stayed home that is what's happened (It's) (just) (that) (now) (that) (I've) (stayed) (home) I'm usually aware of when these things occurred
sw4821.dff	33	A	and it happened (and)
sw4821.dff	34	B	(I) (myself) the reason why I listen to N P R and the reason why I watch MACNEIL LEHRER
sw4821.dff	36	B	rather than the network news shows at night although I do watch a local ten o'clock in the evening news which carries over a lot of the national news stories
sw4821.dff	38	B	is that quite often it seems to me the national doesn't do a very good job of analysis
sw4821.dff	40	B	The local doesn't either but I feel that MACNEIL LEHRER get a little more deeply into some of the issues that are really current
sw4821.dff	42	B	And perhaps newspapers do that but as I said I don't have time to sit down and read a newspaper and frankly when I have read a newspaper
sw4821.dff	44	B	I haven't noticed that kind of analysis either
sw4821.dff	46	B	So
sw4821.dff	46	B	there is some danger to that of course too
sw4821.dff	46	B	Because if the analysis is inaccurate or biased or whatever then how good is it
sw4821.dff	46	B	But I like a little more indepth coverage and I think that's what maybe appealing to you too on something like TWENTY TWENTY (or)
sw4821.dff	48	B	FORTY-EIGHT HOURS
sw4821.dff	49	A	It kind of gives you the whole story or more of the story
sw4821.dff	51	A	(That) (kind) (of) (thing)
sw4821.dff	53	A	(So)
sw4821.dff	54	B	I'm more interested in trying to understand what's going on in the world
sw4821.dff	56	B	rather than simply being aware (you) (know) (there) that an event has occurred
sw4821.dff	58	B	I like to stand back and get a slightly bigger picture
sw4821.dff	58	B	Maybe because I'm easily confused by detail
sw4821.dff	58	B	(I) (don't) (know)
sw4821.dff	59	A	(I) (know) (what) (you're) (saying)
sw4821.dff	60	B	(So)
sw4821.dff	61	A	But I try and catch most of those programs on Wednesday's and Friday's and if I miss them (you) (know) I try and tape them if I'm out (that) (kind) (of) (thing) (I) (try) (and) (tape) (them) so I can sit back and watch them
sw4821.dff	61	A	And it's pretty interesting
sw4821.dff	62	B	(When) you have young children
sw4821.dff	64	B	So those evening shows are probably (also) at a time when you're at liberty to take some time off and be in front of the T V set for awhile without interruption
sw4821.dff	65	A	Plus I find that I have to video tape quite a bit of things
sw4821.dff	66	B	(you) (do)
sw4821.dff	67	A	(If) (I) (don't) (want) (any) (interruptions)
sw4821.dff	69	A	(That) (kind) (of) (thing)
sw4821.dff	70	B	When is your good watching time
sw4821.dff	71	A	it seems like ten o'clock at night
sw4821.dff	72	B	(Yes)
sw4821.dff	72	B	(that's) (what)
sw4821.dff	73	A	Unfortunately but that's what it seems like (ten) (o'clock) (at) (night)
sw4821.dff	74	B	I have older children
sw4821.dff	76	B	and getting dinner on the table
sw4821.dff	76	B	I come from the east coast and (I) (was) it amazed me when I got out here to the midwest and found out that even though they're an hour earlier in time they still watch the news when
sw4822.dff	15	A	that's good because sometimes I wonder being a lay person out there not knowing exactly what's going on in space
sw4822.dff	15	A	Whether they're going ahead and doing things and whether or not we're spending too much money on the programs and not spending enough money on the earth that we have here
sw4822.dff	15	A	(Being) to me all this space exploration that we've done thus far has told us that there's no other place like earth
sw4822.dff	15	A	That we can't live on Mars
sw4822.dff	15	A	(we) (can't) (live) (there)
sw4822.dff	15	A	this is the place that we have to live
sw4822.dff	15	A	there's no other resource for us to look at other than here
sw4822.dff	15	A	So it's kind of like to me I would like to see a lot more money being put toward taking care of the environment (that) (we) (have) (here) and not so much emphasis put on what's going out in space (and) (what) not that I want everything to halt and let's forget about the space program or whatever because we're always curious and we always need to know more things
sw4822.dff	15	A	But to me it's kind of like let's try and clean up the air that we have here
sw4822.dff	15	A	Let's try to take care of the lakes that are getting polluted and the other things that are going on here
sw4822.dff	15	A	(Mainly) (because) (the) (space) (program) (has) (taught) (us) (that) (there) (is) (no) (other) (place) (for) (us)
sw4822.dff	15	A	(this) (is) (it)
sw4822.dff	15	A	if we would have went into space and found Mars a livable planet we probably would have inhabited it and who would have cared about earth
sw4822.dff	15	A	It would have been another planet to kind of take over and continue on
sw4822.dff	15	A	you know and that when I look at the space program itself I think of it as being in terms of it's interesting to learn but it brings down the fact that this earth is it
sw4822.dff	15	A	It's it for us you know what I mean
sw4822.dff	17	A	unless technology makes the decision that we are all going to live in space or whatever
sw4822.dff	17	A	But I would love to go into the space shuttle some day and just see the earth and the different planets and things like that
sw4822.dff	17	A	I think it would be very interesting to do but whether it would be feasible to do I don't know
sw4822.dff	18	B	as far as the practical aspects go I suspect that the space station may actually be a good compromise
sw4822.dff	20	B	between (I'm) (sorry) deep space exploration
sw4822.dff	22	B	and not doing anything
sw4822.dff	23	A	(Sure)
sw4822.dff	24	B	because we have the opportunity to off load some things to the space station
sw4822.dff	25	A	(Exactly)
sw4822.dff	26	B	And perhaps we can find better techniques for doing things that we'd normally do down here
sw4822.dff	28	B	that are damaging to the environment
sw4822.dff	29	A	(Exactly)
sw4822.dff	29	A	(that's) (true) (And) (I) (think) (of) I'm sure you probably have heard of the Genesis program that's going on currently out in the Arizona desert
sw4826.dff	23	A	I'm only up here temporarily on an internship but
sw4826.dff	24	B	(Okay)
sw4826.dff	25	A	I live in Orlando Florida usually
sw4826.dff	25	A	And the schools down there from what I know are not bad
sw4826.dff	25	A	They're pretty good
sw4826.dff	26	B	(that's) (great)
sw4826.dff	27	A	But I know in a lot of rural areas they're not that good
sw4826.dff	29	A	For example I have a brother in North Carolina and he says the schools there are just terrible
sw4826.dff	30	B	I feel that we're way behind
sw4826.dff	30	B	I have a son that is in the fourth grade
sw4826.dff	32	B	and they have just now taken up division
sw4826.dff	33	A	(Wow)
sw4826.dff	34	B	(And)
sw4826.dff	35	A	(That) (is) (slow)
sw4826.dff	36	B	(i-) (e-) my husband and I go to the store and we buy these math books and fractions and multiplication division things and (I) (feel) (like) there are several areas that we're (just) really (really) slow in
sw4826.dff	38	B	And I don't blame the teachers as much as I blame the system
sw4826.dff	38	B	(It) (is)
sw4826.dff	39	A	What do you think's wrong to cause that
sw4826.dff	40	B	well for one thing there's not enough money in the school system
sw4826.dff	40	B	And the money they do have they do not use it wisely
sw4826.dff	42	B	my son's teacher has twenty-seven students
sw4826.dff	44	B	And that's certainly is a lot of students for one person to deal
sw4826.dff	46	B	with on an every day basis
sw4826.dff	47	A	(Perhaps)
sw4826.dff	48	B	but more than that I don't think that they have the authority to command the attention of the children
sw4826.dff	50	B	And when you have two kids in that class that constantly keeps the class in an uproar and you're not at liberty
sw4826.dff	52	B	to do something about it other than give them on campus isolation or send them to the principal's office
sw4826.dff	52	B	(It)
sw4826.dff	53	A	that's one thing I worry about
sw4826.dff	54	B	it (it) can (it) (can) really be bad
sw4826.dff	54	B	also (I) (think) we have a lot of Hispanics
sw4826.dff	55	A	(There) (you) (go)
sw4826.dff	56	B	(and) we have a lot of the county I'm in the minorities are mostly Hispanic
sw4826.dff	57	A	Probably quite a few black people up there (and)
sw4826.dff	58	B	No
sw4826.dff	58	B	we're from the county they marched in
sw4826.dff	58	B	We're in Forsyth county
sw4826.dff	59	A	(is) (that)
sw4826.dff	60	B	yes (and) (we) and there's very few blacks
sw4826.dff	61	A	(okay)
sw4826.dff	62	B	(so) (that's) I hate to say it's not a problem because I hate to feel like they are a problem although they are
sw4826.dff	63	A	(but) (it's) you don't want to seem racist or prejudice (or) (whatever) but then again
sw4826.dff	64	B	But it is a problem
sw4826.dff	65	A	(there) (is) (no) (denying) (that)
sw4826.dff	66	B	especially in the inner city
sw4826.dff	67	A	(Sure) you have to admit that teachers have to slow things down for people who don't understand especially if there's not a very well developed special education program at the school
sw4826.dff	68	B	and you can't put all the children in special education
sw4826.dff	69	A	(That's) (you) (can't) (do) (that)
sw4826.dff	70	B	and if the parents do not care enough to take an interest in whether the homework is done
sw4826.dff	73	A	I grew up in Nebraska
sw4826.dff	75	A	and the school that I went to there was fantastic
sw4826.dff	75	A	(It) I really consider myself very lucky
sw4826.dff	75	A	we had a school that had classes probably about the same size you're talking twenty-seven thirty kids to a class
sw4826.dff	77	A	(But)
sw4826.dff	78	B	But your teacher had control
sw4826.dff	79	A	We zipped along (I) (I)
sw4826.dff	81	A	(was) I was doing mathematics fractions and division and multiplication by the third grade easily
sw4826.dff	82	B	(I)
sw4826.dff	84	B	(believe) (I) (was) (too)
sw4826.dff	85	A	But you're With all this don't hurt the kids and don't abuse their rights you've also taken
sw4826.dff	87	A	something away from the discipline (I) (think)
sw4826.dff	88	B	it really is a concern of mine because if we could afford it my son would be in private school
sw4826.dff	90	B	(We) (just) (cannot) (afford) (it)
sw4826.dff	91	A	I was going to ask you if that was an option
sw4826.dff	92	B	(if)
sw4829.dff	1	A	(Okay)
sw4829.dff	1	A	(let) (me) (see)
sw4829.dff	1	A	Unfortunately we are not much into recycling
sw4829.dff	3	A	we don't do enough
sw4829.dff	3	A	I know we don't (so)
sw4829.dff	3	A	(although) (lately) (I've) (been) a friend of mine that I spend a lot of time with does recycle quite a bit and it's interesting to watch some of the things that she does and then she's almost had an impact on me where she doesn't say anything to me when she comes to my house but I can kind of tell it bothers her so
sw4829.dff	5	A	just unconsciously I've stopped buying a lot of paper plates and paper cups and I don't do that anymore
sw4829.dff	5	A	I don't know why I just don't
sw4829.dff	5	A	just from socializing with her (so)
sw4829.dff	6	B	how is recycling done in your community
sw4829.dff	6	B	(Is)
sw4829.dff	7	A	there's not a whole lot there really isn't
sw4829.dff	7	A	I know in my mother's neighborhood in San Antonio each house has they're given three baskets
sw4829.dff	9	A	and they put them out on a certain day of the week
sw4829.dff	11	A	and each home does participate but we really don't have anything close in this area that do anything
sw4829.dff	11	A	and some of the communities that do the residents are having to pay to participate in it
sw4829.dff	13	A	Which really doesn't make sense
sw4829.dff	14	B	Over here they have several private companies that you can take recycled
sw4829.dff	16	B	materials to
sw4829.dff	16	B	But if you want to take them all to one place the first Saturday of every month they have certain places that you can drop them off
sw4829.dff	16	B	That's what I do
sw4829.dff	16	B	and I recycle aluminum glass newspapers
sw4829.dff	17	A	(that's) (good)
sw4829.dff	18	B	it's nice to have one place that you can take them all to instead of driving the glass to one place (and)
sw4829.dff	19	A	That's another thing
sw4829.dff	19	A	You have to
sw4829.dff	21	A	go to different places to do that
sw4829.dff	22	B	so that's nice
sw4829.dff	22	B	it would be really nice if they came to the house to pick it up and they just were talking about a bill in Tucson about that but it didn't go through
sw4829.dff	23	A	But I heard that most homes that do participate in that are having to pay a monthly fee to do that
sw4829.dff	23	A	Which I don't know it just doesn't make sense to me
sw4829.dff	24	B	I guess what they were talking about here was reducing the garbage collection in order to make that up
sw4829.dff	26	B	(or) (something)
sw4829.dff	28	B	so I guess that's one option
sw4829.dff	29	A	(That's) (good) (that's) (good)
sw4829.dff	30	B	I guess one thing they're working on now is recycling plastics too
sw4829.dff	32	B	have you noticed that on the bottom of plastic goods they have this little number now that tells what
sw4829.dff	34	B	kind of plastic it is
sw4829.dff	35	A	No
sw4829.dff	36	B	(I) (guess) the problem with plastic is there's so many different kinds that you can't recycle you can't just throw all plastic into one recycler
sw4829.dff	37	A	I didn't know that
sw4829.dff	38	B	So now (they're) (marking) (they're) (I) (don't) (know) (there's) six seven eight different kind of plastics and they mark on the bottom what kind it is
sw4829.dff	40	B	So (I) (guess) that makes it easy to recycle and then they're
sw4829.dff	42	B	(they're) trying to make plastic goods that don't have a bunch of different plastics in them that are (that) (are) only made out of one kind of plastic that
sw4829.dff	44	B	that makes it easier (I) (guess)
sw4829.dff	45	A	(that's) (good)
sw4829.dff	45	A	(I'm) unfortunately Garland doesn't (I) (don't) (know) (they) (don't) do anything like that (or) (you) (know) I read those little slips that come in to your utility bills
sw4829.dff	47	A	or your garbage collection and they haven't talked about doing something like that
sw4829.dff	48	B	Where does your friend go to to recycle
sw4829.dff	49	A	She lives in Garland and I'm not sure what she does
sw4829.dff	49	A	But she's very heavy in that and she takes her own bags to the grocery store
sw4829.dff	51	A	I (really) don't think she has any paper products in her house
sw4829.dff	53	A	and just a lot of things I've learned off of her that to start doing
sw4829.dff	53	A	And she does make a lot of sense
sw4829.dff	55	A	(Just) her whole house is like wow
sw4829.dff	56	B	(I) (guess) that's how it gets passed on
sw4829.dff	56	B	when one person you hear
sw4829.dff	58	B	from another person and then you pass it on
sw4829.dff	60	B	It seems to be catching on slowly but surely (I) (guess)
sw4829.dff	61	A	And my little boy watches a program that was really neat
sw4829.dff	61	A	I sat and watched him
sw4829.dff	61	A	You know the Barney
sw4829.dff	61	A	I don't know if you know the little character Barney
sw4829.dff	63	A	They had one on (that) (type) (of) (thing) (and) how children can do that and how to save water when you brush your teeth in water and it's really caught on and he's only four (and) (he's) (really) (caught) (on)
sw4829.dff	64	B	(Wow) (that's) (cute)
sw4829.dff	66	B	(That's) (neat) (When) (you)
sw4829.dff	67	A	And keep the refrigerator door closed (and) (that) (kind) (of) (thing)
sw4829.dff	67	A	He's really caught on so that's really neat
sw4829.dff	68	B	when you start early (I) (guess)
sw4830.dff	54	B	his last appeal was denied two days before his sentence was up
sw4830.dff	55	A	(really)
sw4830.dff	56	B	So his appeal was denied and two days later he got out of jail
sw4830.dff	57	A	(It)
sw4830.dff	58	B	For cocaine possession
sw4830.dff	60	B	But that was absurd
sw4830.dff	60	B	there was no reason
sw4830.dff	61	A	(I) (know) (that)
sw4830.dff	62	B	the appeal process should have dragged on that long for a six month sentence
sw4830.dff	63	A	(And) (I) (don't) (know)
sw4830.dff	63	A	what would you do to change it
sw4830.dff	63	A	To make it better
sw4830.dff	64	B	(the) (only) (I) (wa-) the appeal procedure is the only thing I can possibly think of
sw4830.dff	64	B	like I said as far as removing of the jury and having the judge sentence that's absurd
sw4830.dff	64	B	There's no way that could work
sw4830.dff	65	A	I don't agree with that at all
sw4830.dff	66	B	(but)
sw4830.dff	67	A	Imagine the guilt that person would have
sw4830.dff	68	B	(exactly)
sw4830.dff	69	A	burned out
sw4830.dff	69	A	(There's)
sw4830.dff	70	B	(Exactly)
sw4830.dff	71	A	there's no possible way that you could feel good about yourself
sw4830.dff	73	A	If you had to do something like that day after day
sw4830.dff	74	B	No one would want the job
sw4830.dff	75	A	No
sw4830.dff	75	A	(Not) (really)
sw4830.dff	76	B	and like I said (you) (know) everyone has their opinions about every case
sw4830.dff	77	A	do you think people should have a trial is they're caught dead to rights like
sw4830.dff	78	B	I feel that everyone is entitled to a trial by jury
sw4830.dff	78	B	(that) (s-)
sw4830.dff	79	A	supposing I come up to you and I just point blank kill you
sw4830.dff	80	B	were there witnesses
sw4830.dff	81	A	In other words you're saying that you have to find out whether it's premeditated or
sw4830.dff	83	A	what the circumstances were
sw4830.dff	84	B	That you can't remove the jury regardless of the case
sw4830.dff	86	B	you could have fifty people in audience watching
sw4830.dff	88	B	a murder take place and there's still mitigating circumstances
sw4831.dff	1	A	when you're with a big company or a big organization a lot of times the benefits are good and the pay is regular but sometimes you don't get tuned in to what's going on
sw4831.dff	1	A	And (I) (think) the biggest benefit or the biggest benefit other than wages that anybody could get in dealing with a large company is to be in a situation where you get to know what's going on
sw4831.dff	1	A	And maybe that's probably the toughest thing in the whole world to do
sw4831.dff	1	A	what's your feeling about benefits
sw4831.dff	1	A	What sort of benefits would you like to get from a big company
sw4831.dff	2	B	since I'm kind of on the older side (I) (just) (feel) (like) when I start talking about benefits I'm concerned about medical benefits
sw4831.dff	2	B	my husband works for McDonald Douglas and so his medical benefits are so excellent that's really great
sw4831.dff	4	B	I work for a bank Western Financial
sw4831.dff	6	B	And they don't let me know really about anything that's going on
sw4831.dff	6	B	Even some of the immediate things that I need to know I don't know it until the next hour and all of a sudden we know we've got changes made
sw4831.dff	6	B	We're changing departments
sw4831.dff	6	B	We're changing policies
sw4831.dff	6	B	We're changing doing other kinds of things
sw4831.dff	6	B	Which to me is disturbing
sw4831.dff	6	B	I feel like if I don't necessarily need to be involved since I'm pretty much on a low level you are there
sw4831.dff	6	B	I'm pretty much on a low level as far as the company is concerned
sw4831.dff	6	B	But I do kind of like to know what's going on and what's happening and I think I can be a better and more effective employee if I
sw4831.dff	7	A	(th-) (I)
sw4831.dff	8	B	had a little bit more information along that line
sw4831.dff	9	A	I (I) work for (the) (government) (and) (actually) (I) (work) (for) the F B I
sw4831.dff	10	B	(my) (gosh)
sw4831.dff	11	A	(and) (so) there's lots of things (that) we don't get told
sw4831.dff	11	A	For good reason
sw4831.dff	11	A	but (basically) there's lots of things (that) we should know about projects
sw4831.dff	11	A	I'm an engineer
sw4831.dff	13	A	I'm a COTR
sw4831.dff	13	A	(And) (sometim-) and I worked in the same lab with a guy and we didn't really know that much about each other's projects for two years
sw4831.dff	13	A	And we should have we're now collaborating
sw4831.dff	15	A	And
sw4831.dff	16	B	(And) (it) ()
sw4831.dff	17	A	for two years we didn't
sw4831.dff	17	A	which was (kind) (of) stupid
sw4831.dff	17	A	(but) our organization is doing something else on Monday
sw4831.dff	17	A	for all unclassified programs we're having (little) tables put up in front of lab in the hallways (and) all the other employees are (going) (to) (come) (around) (and) see what (sort) (of) things we do
sw4831.dff	17	A	Which I thought was (kind) (of) interesting (and)
sw4831.dff	18	B	(that) (is) (interesting)
sw4831.dff	19	A	(But) (but) that that sort (sort) (of) (thing)
sw4831.dff	21	A	But I think you can tolerate a lot of problems if you understand what's going on
sw4831.dff	22	B	(Exactly)
sw4831.dff	23	A	(but) (of) (course) most of the time management has a hard time (distributing) (or) getting the word out to the people who must know
sw4831.dff	23	A	(And) (if) (you) (don't) (really) (count)
sw4831.dff	23	A	If you're not part of the program you might not get told for months
sw4831.dff	23	A	Or you might if it doesn't impact you directly
sw4831.dff	23	A	(Or) (if) (your) (management) (doesn't) (think) (that)
sw4831.dff	23	A	but regard to benefits
sw4831.dff	23	A	most big organizations have decent benefits like retirement (and) (that) (sort) (of) (thing)
sw4831.dff	23	A	In the private sector (I) (would) (think) (that) one of the major situations especially when you reach the mid-fifties is keeping a job until you retire
sw4831.dff	24	B	(A-)
sw4831.dff	25	A	And engineers are baggage as they get older to most companies
sw4831.dff	25	A	(And) it's (very) much like the military it windows out
sw4831.dff	25	A	you think boy I'm getting more money and I'm getting more responsibility (I'm) (doing) (this)
sw4831.dff	25	A	But as you climb (up) that tree pretty soon the branches get smaller on the top of the tree
sw4831.dff	27	A	and pretty soon somebody falls off
sw4831.dff	27	A	I've fallen off twice in the private sector
sw4831.dff	29	A	and I can get up
sw4831.dff	30	B	(I) (know)
sw4831.dff	30	B	it seems to be (kind) (of) scary (Because) (you) (think) (of) my son's eighteen now and he wants to go into engineering
sw4831.dff	30	B	And the branches of engineering that he wants to go into is now kind of open and he's interested in basically three different areas
sw4831.dff	30	B	But it's difficult for me to try to give him any (kind) (of) advice (or) (to) (advise) (him) or anything like that
sw4831.dff	30	B	He needs to do his own course of investigation and see what he can do because who knows what's going to happen in another thirty years
sw4831.dff	32	B	And in thirty years it becomes pretty critical
sw4831.dff	32	B	my brother-in-law I mean he's sixty
sw4831.dff	32	B	He's not ready to retire but his company is closing up
sw4831.dff	34	B	And because of the defense cutbacks (and) (all) (that) (kind) (of) (stuff)
sw4831.dff	34	B	And all the nuclear and stuff which is what he was working on
sw4831.dff	34	B	He's getting cut back and he's not ready to retire
sw4831.dff	35	A	he may be retired
sw4834.dff	1	A	(I) (guess) by what you said you don't feel you're privacy has been invaded anytime recently
sw4834.dff	2	B	No not really
sw4834.dff	2	B	the only thing that annoys me is when people call and you have solicitation calls
sw4834.dff	4	B	(That's) (the) (only) (thing) (that) (bothers) (me)
sw4834.dff	4	B	That's not really invading my privacy
sw4834.dff	6	B	do you feel that yours is invaded
sw4834.dff	7	A	no I wouldn't call it invading my privacy by any means
sw4834.dff	7	A	(I) (would) there's a lot of times though you get those calls you know when you're sitting at home wanting to relax (or) (whatnot) and next thing you know someone calls and wants to sell you this or that and it's real hard to tell them that you're not interested
sw4834.dff	7	A	Or you do tell them you're not interested and they still keep asking you and keep badgering you about it and that aggravates me
sw4834.dff	7	A	But I don't know that you could call that invading my privacy because if we don't want that to happen all we have to do is just call the phone company and say look I want my name unlisted (or) (want) (my)
sw4834.dff	8	B	but that doesn't work
sw4834.dff	9	A	It doesn't
sw4834.dff	10	B	no because a lot of times they dial sequentially
sw4834.dff	10	B	They (get) (your) (name) (from) if you enter any type of contest (or) (anything)
sw4834.dff	12	B	you enter a sweepstake in the local department store for a shopping spree (or) (something) you put your phone number on there they pass your phone number on to another company
sw4834.dff	14	B	(or) (you) or the newspapers they just dial randomly (and) (stuff)
sw4834.dff	14	B	the newspapers here even call people who already subscribe
sw4834.dff	16	B	And while I was subscribing to the paper I got so upset at them that they
sw4834.dff	18	B	you call me one more time I'm going to stop subscribing
sw4834.dff	20	B	And the local papers ask them to remove your number from their list and you call up during regular hours they have a special department they'll take your numbers out of their lists
sw4834.dff	22	B	but the Orlando paper they refused to take it off of the lists and they call every month
sw4834.dff	24	B	And when you have more than one phone number you get a call on each number you have
sw4834.dff	25	A	(Good) (grief)
sw4834.dff	25	A	let me ask you about this
sw4834.dff	25	A	Here's something that has been kind of concerning me lately
sw4834.dff	25	A	My fiance received a bill from a Lord and Taylor company
sw4834.dff	27	A	they're a department store
sw4834.dff	29	A	She received a bill from them that she had visited (some) (sto-) (and) (I) (think) (it) (was) there in Florida (maybe) (it) (was) in Miami
sw4834.dff	29	A	(That) (she) (had) (visited) (a) (store) (there) and they had this bill that she had bought such and such amount of merchandise over two hundred dollars worth of merchandise
sw4834.dff	31	A	and the date that she supposedly made this purchase she was in Denver with me for Thanksgiving
sw4834.dff	33	A	and apparently what had happened is someone used her social security number
sw4834.dff	35	A	and I've heard recently that this is a common occurrence where people (are) (using) (s-) they use Joe Blow's social security number and can potentially ruin someone's credit
sw4834.dff	36	B	If you know a person's social security number and their mailing address and their mother's maiden name
sw4834.dff	38	B	you can basically become that person
sw4834.dff	40	B	if the purchase was made mail order they should have a record of where it was shipped to
sw4834.dff	42	B	and since it wasn't shipped to her address she could prove that it wasn't her
sw4834.dff	42	B	if it was some coming into the store and stuff then whoever made the purchase would have had find some (kind) (of) document
sw4834.dff	44	B	(and) (wh-) (the) (signature) they should be able to provide you a copy with that signature and if they can't provide a signature they'll have to eat the charge
sw4834.dff	45	A	(y-)
sw4834.dff	46	B	But if (the) (pers-) has her social security number I'd be real concerned that she's (not) blacklist on (what) (is) (it) (it's) Telecredit or something
sw4834.dff	48	B	because she won't be able to cash checks because most places verify through there
sw4834.dff	48	B	She probably won't be able to open a checking account or anything without a lot of hassle
sw4834.dff	49	A	we got it cleared up eventually
sw4834.dff	49	A	What happened
sw4840.dff	1	A	Okay we just got our income tax return and I'm perfectly happy
sw4840.dff	1	A	What about you
sw4840.dff	2	B	(let's) (see)
sw4840.dff	2	B	I haven't got mine yet because my parents are getting all that stuff at home
sw4840.dff	4	B	in the Bay area
sw4840.dff	6	B	So I'm not sure how much I'm getting back but I'm pretty sure I should get (back) a little bit since student (so)
sw4840.dff	8	B	It's not too much
sw4840.dff	10	B	Not too bad though
sw4840.dff	11	A	But as far as writing checks out and paying taxes I think it's pretty high
sw4840.dff	11	A	But I guess it's where we have to be (where) we have to keep raising them (for) to keep some of the things that we have (and)
sw4840.dff	12	B	it's one of those necessities of life that we all have to pay taxes although it is kind of a pain sometimes (though)
sw4840.dff	13	A	It's just scary though (about) How high are the taxes going to be when my children are my age
sw4840.dff	15	A	(that's) (scary) (too)
sw4840.dff	17	A	Because it's not anything like the way it was when I was young and small and a child
sw4840.dff	17	A	(So) (that's) (a) (scary) (part) (too) (that) (you) (have) (to) (think) (about)
sw4840.dff	18	B	and
sw4840.dff	20	B	as time goes on (things) (get) (more) (expensive) (and) because we were increasingly complex society that
sw4840.dff	22	B	day by day things get more expensive as well as more complex
sw4840.dff	24	B	And taxes are one of the ways to help pay for a lot of the things that are needed in this society
sw4840.dff	26	B	everything (you) (know) from medicare to social security to feeding the homeless to maintaining prisons to maintaining polices or fire departments and things like that
sw4840.dff	26	B	And now there's more and more things that need attending to (and) (that) (sort) (of) (thing)
sw4840.dff	26	B	And
sw4840.dff	28	B	it's becoming a larger responsibility but someone has to pay for it and that's us
sw4840.dff	34	B	the budget's not big enough as it is
sw4840.dff	36	B	And
sw4840.dff	38	B	makes you wonder when there's countries out there that have tax rates of close to fifty percent or higher
sw4840.dff	40	B	it's like fifty percent of everything you make is already gone before you even get it
sw4840.dff	42	B	And that's kind of a scary thought
sw4840.dff	42	B	I hope it doesn't come down to that
sw4840.dff	44	B	But on the other hand while those countries that have high taxes also have things like socialized medicine (things) (like) (that) (too) which are nice fringe benefits of it
sw4840.dff	44	B	So everyone has the access to medical facilities as well as the doctors
sw4840.dff	44	B	(That) (sort) (of) (thing)
sw4840.dff	46	B	And it's good but it's the price they pay
sw4840.dff	48	B	it can be argued one way or another whether economically it's actually good for the country (or) (good) (for) (any) (given) (country) to have that because those countries (as) (far) (as) (cash) (flow) (a) (lot) tend to have a much slower cash flow
sw4840.dff	50	B	and don't generate a large amount of revenue because there's so little currency flow through out the economic system
sw4840.dff	51	A	(you) (sure) (do) (know) (a) (lot)
sw4840.dff	52	B	just keeping up with the times that's all
sw4840.dff	54	B	as it turns out it's one of those interests I kind of like to keep up on
sw4840.dff	54	B	Because it's nice to know that when you know I do start working that I like to know where my tax dollars are going too
sw4840.dff	56	B	(work) (hard) (to) (get) (I) (like) (to) (know) (where) (it's) (going) (to)
sw4840.dff	57	A	(That's) (true)
sw4840.dff	59	A	What do you think about these items that are going to be taxed even more
sw4840.dff	59	A	Like tobacco and that kind of thing
sw4840.dff	60	B	I think in a way it's good in a way it's not
sw4840.dff	60	B	but I think in general it's probably good
sw4840.dff	60	B	a lot of things like tobacco and alcohol and things like that in the past have been not taxed because there's been such a large lobby against them (against)
sw4840.dff	62	B	the taxes for them
sw4840.dff	62	B	Sponsored by the alcohol and tobacco companies
sw4840.dff	64	B	And things like tobacco they're a proven health hazard to smokers
sw4840.dff	66	B	as well as nonsmokers
sw4840.dff	68	B	And as far as the safety thing like in San Luis Obispo for example there's an ordnance which states that there's no smoking in any public areas
sw4840.dff	68	B	And so if you walk into any restaurant or any hotel there's no smoking allowed anywhere
sw4840.dff	69	A	really
sw4856.dff	1	A	in Texas they do have the capital punishment and I'm probably one that has to agree with it too
sw4856.dff	1	A	(there) (a-) some things that go on that I just feel that (that) is a need
sw4856.dff	1	A	I don't know
sw4856.dff	1	A	A lot of people don't feel that way either (but) (I) (just) (feel) (that)
sw4856.dff	2	B	I don't know how much publicity it's gotten outside of the state but California we just put somebody to death
sw4856.dff	4	B	for I think it was a double murder
sw4856.dff	4	B	to be honest I didn't pay that much attention to the details of it
sw4856.dff	4	B	but it had a lot of controversy out here
sw4856.dff	4	B	basically because in California people like to protest about everything
sw4856.dff	6	B	but I agree I believe that there are a number of crimes that capital punishment is the best way to go
sw4856.dff	8	B	the big disagreement I have is that in California the appeals process is so extensive and takes so long that you end up spending a huge amount of money in ten to fifteen years before you can actually put somebody to death for a crime
sw4856.dff	9	A	that is a consequence
sw4856.dff	10	B	And that's ridiculous
sw4856.dff	10	B	(if) (you) (can) the trial is supposed to prove within a reasonable doubt that the person is guilty
sw4856.dff	12	B	and then they have appeals
sw4856.dff	12	B	that's fine but it shouldn't take more
sw4856.dff	14	B	than a few years
sw4856.dff	14	B	(I) (should) (think)
sw4856.dff	16	B	two or three years maximum you should be able to know and you should be able to either put the guy to death or he's innocent
sw4856.dff	18	B	(it's) if he's guilty for multiple murders (or) (whatever) (the) (case) (may) (be)
sw4856.dff	21	A	maybe that's something that needs to be worked on
sw4856.dff	23	A	But I just feel that capital punishment needs to stay within the system
sw4856.dff	23	A	Not all states have them but (I) I'm not sure if that was in was that the man that claimed he was abused (or)
sw4856.dff	24	B	(he) (was) (like) (the)
sw4856.dff	25	A	(And) (that) (he) (had)
sw4856.dff	26	B	(the)
sw4856.dff	27	A	(he)
sw4856.dff	28	B	(the) defense they're were given was that his mother had been an alcoholic when she was
sw4856.dff	30	B	pregnant with him and so he wasn't mentally competent or anything else
sw4856.dff	32	B	Which is ridiculous
sw4856.dff	34	B	and the court found him competent and he knew what he was doing (and) (everything) (else)
sw4856.dff	36	B	it was the best defense they could come up with
sw4856.dff	37	A	And how long had he been appealing
sw4856.dff	37	A	How long was that
sw4856.dff	38	B	I forget
sw4856.dff	38	B	I think it was something like twelve years or something
sw4856.dff	39	A	(Gosh)
sw4856.dff	39	A	(Boy)
sw4856.dff	40	B	it was something really outrageous
sw4856.dff	41	A	(Boy)
sw4856.dff	41	A	and it seems like it rarely does happen
sw4856.dff	41	A	it's not used that often
sw4856.dff	43	A	At least here in Texas but I think it's something that needs to stay
sw4856.dff	43	A	(I) (really) (do)
sw4856.dff	44	B	I think in general punishment in the United States is a lot weaker than it should be
sw4856.dff	44	B	(it) (needs) (to) (be) it's (kind) (of) like the justice system in the United States is (kind) (of) like the dog poops on the carpet and you wait three months and then you put his nose in it and spank him for it
sw4856.dff	46	B	there's no connection between the two
sw4856.dff	48	B	you take (you) (know) (most) (of) (the) people who are committing violent crimes most of them not all by any means (but) (a) (large) (percentage) are the kind of people who are living very much day to day in the first place
sw4856.dff	50	B	they don't really see past next week much less next year
sw4856.dff	52	B	And to say if I kill somebody then a decade from now I might face the punishment
sw4856.dff	54	B	That's not real
sw4856.dff	54	B	It doesn't have any real impact on them
sw4856.dff	55	A	My sister and I were wondering about this recently because an old friend of ours in California
sw4856.dff	57	A	this happened about a week ago
sw4856.dff	59	A	her husband just killed her and we're wondering if that has an effect
sw4856.dff	59	A	if something (you) (know) does it happen within that I don't know
sw4856.dff	60	B	you mean would he be put to death for that
sw4856.dff	62	B	largely depends on the circumstances and generally from what I understand it's only the most brutal types of things usually
sw4856.dff	62	B	Where it's multiple
sw4856.dff	63	A	(I) (think) (you're)
sw4856.dff	64	B	if they can say things like he was just temporarily insane because of
sw4856.dff	66	B	some domestic squabble then
sw4856.dff	68	B	they'll give him twenty years with parole in twelve or something like that
sw4856.dff	69	A	And I have an uncle that is an attorney that defends people
sw4858.dff	1	A	I'm of the age that could have gone although I didn't and (I) (guess) looking back on it I tend to think it was mostly a mistake
sw4858.dff	3	A	On the other hand the more I learn about the history the more I see it was incremental decisions
sw4858.dff	3	A	Any one of which was sort of understandable at the time
sw4858.dff	5	A	but on the whole I think it probably was the wrong thing to do
sw4858.dff	5	A	How about you
sw4858.dff	6	B	I was just in high school (I) (guess) when it ended
sw4858.dff	8	B	Ended up being I was in the last lottery
sw4858.dff	10	B	And I was glad it was over by then
sw4858.dff	12	B	I've never really totally understood what our purpose was over there
sw4858.dff	12	B	Just because we didn't really do anything when we went over it seems like
sw4858.dff	14	B	(we) those people that I know I work with several that were over there and for some of them it was (just) (kind) (of) (I) (don't) (know) not so much a holiday (I) (guess) that's how they tend to talk about it
sw4858.dff	14	B	But that they just kind of lived out in the woods and ever now and then they'd go and shoot their rifles and then they'd
sw4858.dff	16	B	(come) (back) (and)
sw4858.dff	18	B	But that they weren't really allowed to do anything
sw4858.dff	18	B	(I) to me it seems like we only went halfway
sw4858.dff	18	B	If even halfway
sw4858.dff	19	A	it's funny
sw4858.dff	19	A	Tonight I was
sw4858.dff	21	A	helping my kid with an essay on Stalin
sw4858.dff	23	A	And I was thinking in the course of talking to him about it how in World War Two the personalties of Stalin Hitler and Churchill more or less defined the war and actually when you think back on the big events of the war it was almost a personal struggle among these three (I) (guess) you'd have to call them great men in some sense
sw4858.dff	25	A	they're certainly all leaders (and) with their nations pretty solidly behind each one of them
sw4858.dff	27	A	(And) (I) (got) (a) (feeling) (that) (some) (of) (that) (was) (involved) (in) (the) (early) (decisions) (of) (the) (Vietnam) (war)
sw4858.dff	27	A	That (the) people saw the cold war as you had to draw a line and defend it
sw4858.dff	27	A	Otherwise they'd get you someplace else
sw4858.dff	29	A	Looking back it seems like that was only partly true
sw4858.dff	29	A	That there might have been a better place to draw the line
sw4858.dff	29	A	I guess you can say that a certain amount of resolve and willingness to fight brought the cold war to an end
sw4858.dff	29	A	But I don't think you can just fight anywhere just in order to call the bully out and beat him
sw4858.dff	29	A	And I have a feeling (that) that's part of what was involved in the Vietnamese war
sw4858.dff	29	A	They felt like this was a place where we could draw a line
sw4858.dff	31	A	beat them and they wouldn't come forward
sw4858.dff	31	A	And
sw4858.dff	33	A	we were wrong
sw4858.dff	33	A	But (I) like I said the more I hear about it the more I can see each decision that was made as being understandable
sw4858.dff	33	A	But the accumulative effect was to really get into a hopeless situation where and as you say going halfway was probably worse than committing (to) (a) completely and winning it whatever that would mean
sw4858.dff	34	B	(I) (think) we did learn some lessons that we weren't prepared for (I) (guess) the best word would be the atrocities of war
sw4858.dff	36	B	the other wars seemed like a valiant war
sw4858.dff	38	B	(they) (seemed) (like) (a) (valiant) (thing)
sw4858.dff	38	B	(You) (knew) (you) (knew) who was good
sw4858.dff	38	B	You knew who was bad
sw4858.dff	40	B	And it was a traditional battle of (kind) (of) good versus evil (you) (know)
sw4858.dff	41	A	(you're) (not)
sw4858.dff	42	B	(whichever) (way) (it) (is)
sw4858.dff	42	B	But in the Vietnam war it seems like (it) (was) the sides and the lines that were drawn are all confused as to whose good and whose bad (and)
sw4858.dff	43	A	(It's) (ambivalent)
sw4858.dff	44	B	(and) (the) (even) it seems like even the people had the South Vietnamese the North Vietnamese and of course the Laotians and the Cambodians weren't even supposed to be involved
sw4858.dff	44	B	(But)
sw4858.dff	45	A	what about the domestic effects I was thinking that maybe the most important effect it had was to make it possible and even popular to criticize the government
sw4858.dff	45	A	And they that pendulum started to swing maybe even too far
sw4858.dff	45	A	To the point where supporting a government decision in foreign policy was sort of optional
sw4858.dff	47	A	from the Vietnam war on
sw4858.dff	49	A	And that tradition is still it's dying now but it's still alive as opposed to this Desert Storm stuff may have
sw4858.dff	51	A	killed it
sw4858.dff	51	A	But I think that was one of the biggest that the domestic unrest
sw4859.dff	1	A	Okay
sw4859.dff	1	A	generally I get most of my news in the weekly magazines like TIME NEWSWEEK and U S NEWS AND WORLD REPORT
sw4859.dff	1	A	with occasional smatterings of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL and of course the local paper
sw4859.dff	3	A	But my only complaint is I really don't enough time to look at the articles every day and go through a paper exhaust the details
sw4859.dff	3	A	So that's why I concentrate on weekly magazines
sw4859.dff	4	B	Do you think that the weekly magazines provide you with as much detail information as you'd like
sw4859.dff	5	A	yes
sw4859.dff	5	A	I don't think I have the time to really become a student in every article
sw4859.dff	7	A	and so I like the weekly magazines because it gives me the high points of what's going on
sw4859.dff	9	A	but many times the local news kind of suffers But here I am cheek by jowl with our nation's capital (and)
sw4859.dff	10	B	that's You're very close actually
sw4859.dff	10	B	It's
sw4859.dff	12	B	almost a bedroom community (for)
sw4859.dff	13	A	(Yes)
sw4859.dff	14	B	the capital
sw4859.dff	15	A	(exactly)
sw4859.dff	15	A	when the capital gang always talk about the people inside the beltway I'm saying to myself hey guys I'm inside the beltway
sw4859.dff	17	A	But it turns out that the C N N I think is great
sw4859.dff	19	A	And for things like hurricanes and fast breaking events but generally they're more sound bitish kind of thing and I don't really
sw4859.dff	21	A	I don't really feel as though I've a gotten sufficient dose of news that way
sw4859.dff	22	B	A lot of my information comes from several sources
sw4859.dff	22	B	Probably pretty high up on the list is National Public Radio
sw4859.dff	24	B	which I like
sw4859.dff	25	A	(Yes)
sw4859.dff	26	B	I think it's fairly objective and I always like the letters that they read which tend to accuse them of being too liberal and too conservative
sw4859.dff	26	B	And while there's an inherent filtering process going on just by the letters they choose to read I always figure it's a good thing when any given group is being accused by each side of favoring the other side
sw4859.dff	26	B	that's potential indication of balance
sw4859.dff	26	B	(And) generally I really do believe they are pretty balanced
sw4859.dff	26	B	I also read TIME magazine and we get one of the daily newspapers around here where we go through various sections of the articles and the front section (and)
sw4859.dff	27	A	the MERCURY and the CHRONICLE are the only things that are really can
sw4859.dff	29	A	stand up there
sw4859.dff	30	B	(you) (st-) did you use to live around here
sw4859.dff	31	A	Redwood City
sw4859.dff	31	A	I use to work at Anteks
sw4859.dff	32	B	(okay)
sw4859.dff	32	B	(okay)
sw4859.dff	32	B	I know exactly where that is
sw4859.dff	33	A	Anteks Amdahl and places like that
sw4859.dff	34	B	we get the MERCURY which I generally think is actually a pretty good newspaper
sw4859.dff	36	B	(A-) the newspaper I really been impressed with it when I've read it at times at the LOS ANGELES TIMES
sw4859.dff	38	B	Which I've found to be a very good quality newspaper and I like a lot of the articles there
sw4859.dff	38	B	we don't have cable T V the other thing that you referred to that always sounds really interesting to me is called C SPAN
sw4859.dff	39	A	(Yes)
sw4859.dff	39	A	I enjoy we have both C SPANS here
sw4859.dff	39	A	(but)
sw4859.dff	40	B	Both
sw4859.dff	41	A	really on the public T V MACNEIL LEHRER
sw4859.dff	43	A	is an hour's program (that) (I) (always) if I watch any news program it will be MACNEIL LEHRER
sw4859.dff	45	A	and occasionally C SPAN
sw4859.dff	45	A	I saw the tapes that were run of Marion Berry's drug bust the whole thing was run on that (and)
sw4859.dff	46	B	I never say that
sw4859.dff	46	B	That would have been interesting
sw4859.dff	47	A	(and) (and) (a-) also they have the (the) PARLIAMENT'S QUESTION AND ANSWER PERIOD
sw4859.dff	47	A	(It)
sw4859.dff	48	B	I think that's always fascinating
sw4859.dff	48	B	I wish we had something
sw4859.dff	49	A	(you) (know) when it first tuned in on (that) (I) (it's) (one) (that's) (I) (think) (it) (was) somebody was just ripping the hell out of another person
sw4859.dff	51	A	And I and everybody was making noise in the background
sw4859.dff	51	A	(And) (then)
sw4859.dff	52	B	But it's usually the Prime Minister
sw4859.dff	53	A	Here's this dude in a wig
sw4859.dff	54	B	Thatcher Major
sw4859.dff	55	A	and I said to myself it's another Monty Python that I didn't know about
sw4859.dff	57	A	and then up jumps Margaret Thatcher off her green bench and I said it's Parliament
sw4859.dff	58	B	Which could be another of Monty Python
sw4859.dff	59	A	So I thought to myself I can't wait
sw4859.dff	59	A	I'm going over to Britain you know in mid-May
sw4859.dff	59	A	I'm going to approach my this is how I discovered the Prime Minister's question and answer period (P-)
sw4859.dff	60	B	I have seen that and aside from the level of wit which is much higher than generally in American politics which I really enjoy
sw4859.dff	60	B	I really like the fact that they have a chance to ask hard real questions (I) (think)
sw4859.dff	60	B	And it's unlike the fairly controlled press conferences that Presidents of the United States have here where they always seem
sw4868.dff	1	A	Budgeting activity in our household is kind of an informal (kind) (of) situation
sw4868.dff	1	A	(we) (put) actually what happens is my check gets automatically deposited
sw4868.dff	1	A	I don't even have the glories of bringing home my check anymore
sw4868.dff	1	A	(It) (just) (gets) (deposited)
sw4868.dff	1	A	And
sw4868.dff	3	A	(and) (and) (my) my wife looks at all those bills that come in and (and) all those people are counting on me to have my wife pay them
sw4868.dff	3	A	and so our (our) budgeting (w-) we really don't have a formal budgeting situation
sw4868.dff	3	A	Every time I've ever tried one (it's) I've just got wrapped in my inertia
sw4868.dff	3	A	And I've just decided not to pursue it
sw4868.dff	3	A	what (what's) your budget situation
sw4868.dff	4	B	actually I've had a couple of different situations
sw4868.dff	4	B	My current one has been the most successful
sw4868.dff	4	B	at a certain point in life (an-) my ex-husband was an alcoholic
sw4868.dff	4	B	And we got divorced back in the mid-seventies and that left me with three teenagers
sw4868.dff	5	A	actually that kind of situation is just wonderful for budgets
sw4868.dff	6	B	(It) (certainly) (is)
sw4868.dff	7	A	(Isn't) (it)
sw4868.dff	8	B	But at any rate what happened was that I just absolutely put away all the credit cards
sw4868.dff	8	B	I didn't rip them up
sw4868.dff	8	B	I didn't send them back
sw4868.dff	8	B	(Nothing)
sw4868.dff	8	B	(I) (just) (put) (them) (away)
sw4868.dff	8	B	Because there was one that (it) was really handy to have
sw4868.dff	8	B	If I absolutely had to have something I could go use it
sw4868.dff	10	B	But mostly we just spent cash
sw4868.dff	10	B	Whatever we had
sw4868.dff	10	B	And if we didn't have it we absolutely didn't spend it
sw4868.dff	10	B	But then as things improved once I got them all through college it came to the point where my parents came through the depression
sw4868.dff	10	B	I'm not sure how old you are
sw4868.dff	11	A	my parents too
sw4868.dff	11	A	(You) (you)
sw4868.dff	12	B	(But) (my)
sw4868.dff	13	A	you were born in the (in) (the) late thirties or early forties
sw4868.dff	14	B	Late thirties
sw4868.dff	16	B	And my mother hardly ever spent anything on herself or on the house
sw4868.dff	16	B	And that's kind of the way I was raised
sw4868.dff	16	B	And so I'm not a very demanding person in that aspect
sw4868.dff	16	B	for quite a period of time I just flat didn't spend any money
sw4868.dff	18	B	meanwhile I had a building bank balance
sw4868.dff	18	B	And my intent was that whenever something went on sale that I really had to have I would have the cash to buy it then and there
sw4868.dff	20	B	And not ever have to spend any money on interest
sw4868.dff	21	A	(that's) (good)
sw4868.dff	22	B	And that's the way I've operated ever since then
sw4868.dff	22	B	(It) and if something goes on sale and I don't have the money I still don't buy it
sw4868.dff	23	A	(we) (buy) (what) we just got through buying a twenty-five foot refrigerator a new ceramic top stove and a new dishwasher
sw4868.dff	24	B	(my)
sw4868.dff	25	A	and we put twenty-eight hundred dollars on the charge
sw4868.dff	25	A	Along with my trip to Japan
sw4868.dff	26	B	(my)
sw4868.dff	27	A	which was fourteen or fifteen hundred dollars
sw4868.dff	28	B	(my)
sw4868.dff	29	A	we got a monster bill coming in
sw4868.dff	29	A	but we also have zero interest being paid
sw4868.dff	29	A	And we pay it off as it goes
sw4868.dff	30	B	And that's the way I do my credit cards now
sw4868.dff	31	A	So we never really get that much over extended
sw4868.dff	32	B	I do almost all my purchasing on credit cards
sw4868.dff	34	B	But it's the fact that I have enough of a cushion in the bank so that when they come I can pay them in full
sw4868.dff	35	A	we're doing that
sw4868.dff	35	A	(We) (have) this is our (big) we did redecorating
sw4868.dff	35	A	(you) (know) two new pieces in the family room and new carpet
sw4868.dff	35	A	(we) (just)
sw4868.dff	36	B	(my)
sw4868.dff	37	A	we've just been spending spending spending
sw4868.dff	38	B	(I'm) (envious)
sw4868.dff	38	B	(I)
sw4868.dff	39	A	but we haven't really done anything for a long time because we've had two kids in college that
sw4868.dff	41	A	just have graduated in the past year
sw4868.dff	41	A	(you) (know) we don't have that
sw4868.dff	42	B	It's time for you to do these things then
sw4868.dff	43	A	it's about time that we did that
sw4868.dff	43	A	But the terrible part about it
sw4868.dff	43	A	I've looked at it all and it all looks still pretty good to me
sw4868.dff	43	A	why we need to replace it
sw4868.dff	45	A	but unfortunately my wife really feels as though it's just been an inappropriate thing to that rug is thirteen years old why not replace it
sw4868.dff	45	A	I say it might go for another thirteen but too late we'll never find that out
sw4868.dff	46	B	(This) (is) (so) (funny)
sw4868.dff	46	B	(That's) (wonderful)
sw4868.dff	46	B	(But)
sw4868.dff	47	A	(And)
sw4868.dff	48	B	you're lucky to have her because if you're like me and you have difficulty spending money you need somebody to help you spend it
sw4868.dff	48	B	certain things really do need to be done whether or not you think they should
sw4868.dff	50	B	be or not
sw4868.dff	51	A	I don't spend that much money
sw4868.dff	51	A	we just sort of have had too many obligations to we sort of take care of the kids when they were school and they got through school
sw4868.dff	51	A	And that was the major decade of expenses So we feel as (but) (as) far as any formal budgeting we (just) apparently have been very fortunate
sw4868.dff	51	A	When we want to go out to eat we go out to eat
sw4868.dff	51	A	We never really have to program money for that or make choices But we don't have that uproarious a lifestyle
sw4868.dff	51	A	(After) (all) (we're)
sw4876.dff	8	B	I am a working mother
sw4876.dff	8	B	I have three children and my children since they were very young I've had various different alternatives child care arrangements and like most working mothers I'm really not defensive about it
sw4876.dff	8	B	I personally feel in our particular situation I'm a much better mother when I work out of the home and my kids (I) (think) are very secure well raised children
sw4876.dff	8	B	My comment on this is that we paid an absolute fortune
sw4876.dff	10	B	over the years for a variety of opportunities
sw4876.dff	10	B	So (I) (e-) it is a problem
sw4876.dff	10	B	but as you pointed out (I) (think) the real problem is the low pay child facilities and that is sometimes what some women who have to work that is all they can afford
sw4876.dff	10	B	When our children were very young we had a live in paid baby-sitter that
sw4876.dff	12	B	was wonderful
sw4876.dff	12	B	And then as they got older they went to I preferred to call them schools and they were really all day preschools and they were wonderful
sw4876.dff	12	B	And (I) (think) they got exposed to a lot of neat things
sw4876.dff	13	A	(that's) (interesting)
sw4876.dff	14	B	But we really truly did pay a fortune
sw4876.dff	14	B	we were paying at one point close about five hundred dollars a week for two children
sw4876.dff	15	A	(my) (God)
sw4876.dff	17	A	you must have just one hero ace professional job to support something like that
sw4876.dff	18	B	(I) (mus-) I'm a physician
sw4876.dff	20	B	as is my husband
sw4876.dff	20	B	and I felt very good about working
sw4876.dff	20	B	I'm a pediatrician
sw4876.dff	22	B	but I think there are some wonderful child care opportunities out there for children and we all know the kind of things that you're supposed to look for
sw4876.dff	22	B	(I) (think)
sw4876.dff	23	A	not all of us
sw4876.dff	23	A	what the kind of things you're supposed to look for
sw4876.dff	25	A	I'm an engineer
sw4876.dff	27	A	(And)
sw4876.dff	28	B	(I) (think) it's real important that you have a place that first of all parents have a lot of input into and that they're always welcome and that they have a lot of activities where parents come in during the day and that at any time you can drop in
sw4876.dff	28	B	And we had a really wonderful arrangement I'm with the university
sw4876.dff	30	B	and they had a wonderful program that started at age three and it was about a block away from the hospital where I work
sw4876.dff	30	B	And so many times at lunchtime I would go over and visit the children and eat with them and see what they were doing
sw4876.dff	30	B	(And) (they) (had) (wonderful) (they) (had) (things) (like) gardens and lots of pets and they had a four to one
sw4876.dff	32	B	teacher student ratio
sw4876.dff	32	B	(So) (that) (sort) (of) (an) most of the teachers had degrees
sw4876.dff	33	A	Five hundred dollars a week
sw4876.dff	35	A	For two kids
sw4876.dff	35	A	That's incredible
sw4876.dff	36	B	(It) (was) (incredible)
sw4876.dff	38	B	But it was good
sw4876.dff	38	B	(it) at that time there were two children and they were in special programs and each one was a little over two hundred a week and then (in) (addition) I paid a little bit extra
sw4876.dff	38	B	But
sw4876.dff	40	B	the kids (were) (they) really had some great opportunities
sw4876.dff	40	B	(But) (tha-)
sw4876.dff	41	A	(W-)
sw4876.dff	42	B	what you were alluding to earlier is women who work for minimal wage
sw4876.dff	44	B	and really feel they have to put their children sometimes they do put them in fairly low
sw4876.dff	46	B	paying situations
sw4876.dff	47	A	they could somebody will have a job at three hundred a week to get off welfare and
sw4876.dff	49	A	that's a good starting wage (but)
sw4876.dff	51	A	(boy) three hundred dollars a week doesn't go very far on child care
sw4876.dff	52	B	(No) (even) (that) (really) (I) (think) (I) (don't) (it's) (been) (awhile) (since) (I've) (looked) (at) my youngest child is eight
sw4876.dff	52	B	So it's been a little while since I've looked into daycare centers
sw4876.dff	52	B	But (they) (are)
sw4876.dff	54	B	the good ones do cost maybe sixty dollars a week (since) ()
sw4876.dff	55	A	we used to pay fifty cents an hour to baby-sit
sw4876.dff	55	A	But mine are twenty-two twenty-three and twenty-seven so
sw4876.dff	57	A	(that) I guess baby-sitters now are up at what five dollars an hour
sw4876.dff	58	B	Something like that
sw4876.dff	59	A	(my)
sw4876.dff	60	B	but you made the comment earlier why would someone be interested in children
sw4876.dff	60	B	it has been a real there have been some good entrepreneurial type experiences
sw4876.dff	60	B	And I think they have captured a certain market
sw4876.dff	60	B	(Again) (the) but then there are baby-sitting groups
sw4876.dff	60	B	As a pediatrician one of the things we've been real concerned about is the infections
sw4877.dff	2	A	(Okay)
sw4877.dff	2	A	I guess you're probably in the same situation we're in
sw4877.dff	2	A	We're kind of past having to provide child care
sw4877.dff	2	A	our kids are grown up
sw4877.dff	2	A	We don't have any grandchildren yet
sw4877.dff	2	A	(But) (they're)
sw4877.dff	3	B	How old are your children
sw4877.dff	4	A	one's twenty-six and the other is twenty-one
sw4877.dff	6	A	(So) (they're)
sw4877.dff	7	B	they're going to be getting there
sw4877.dff	8	A	(They're) (they're) (getting) (there)
sw4877.dff	8	A	(there's) (no)
sw4877.dff	10	A	(no) (no) (prospects) (away) (for) (anything) (to) (happen)
sw4877.dff	11	B	(I) (see)
sw4877.dff	12	A	(But)
sw4877.dff	13	B	I have five children
sw4877.dff	13	B	I have a eighteen year old son
sw4877.dff	13	B	The rest of my girls are twenty-three twenty-six twenty-eight and twenty-nine
sw4877.dff	15	B	And I have three granddaughters now
sw4877.dff	17	B	(And) (I) one's in Iowa
sw4877.dff	19	B	And she's a teacher and (what) (she) (does) (is) she
sw4877.dff	21	B	teaches at a preschool
sw4877.dff	22	A	(okay)
sw4877.dff	23	B	and (so) (she) (kind) (of) and they let her bring her little daughter in for free
sw4877.dff	25	B	(so) but she just works part-time
sw4877.dff	27	B	Then I have another daughter in Bountiful Utah and she has to work full-time and it's just tearing her apart
sw4877.dff	27	B	She has a private baby-sitter
sw4877.dff	29	B	And the baby just screams
sw4877.dff	29	B	the baby is seventeen months and (she) (just) (screams)
sw4877.dff	31	B	even if she knows that they're fixing to get ready to go over there
sw4877.dff	31	B	They're not even there yet
sw4877.dff	34	A	(It's) (hard)
sw4877.dff	34	A	(We)
sw4877.dff	35	B	and then I have a seven month old granddaughter and her mother stays home and (they) (live) (with) (us)
sw4877.dff	35	B	as Orange County
sw4877.dff	37	B	is really expensive
sw4877.dff	39	B	They live with us and so of course we love it
sw4877.dff	39	B	Because we get to see this cute little baby all the time
sw4877.dff	39	B	But (she) (just) she used to work in the preschool and child care and she says after working (in) (there) (and) here she was a provider but there's only so much one person can do
sw4877.dff	41	B	She said it's so awful
sw4877.dff	41	B	She said she'll never put her child in a preschool
sw4877.dff	43	B	I'm sure there must be some good ones around here somewhere
sw4877.dff	45	B	But it's really very difficult (and)
sw4877.dff	46	A	What did you do when your kids were growing up
sw4877.dff	46	A	(Were) (you)
sw4877.dff	47	B	(when) the (see) first ten or twelve years I stayed home
sw4877.dff	49	B	And then after that I went to work
sw4877.dff	51	B	And a couple of times (I) (just) (then) I had one job and then that job ran out because it was kind of a government seeded type job
sw4877.dff	51	B	and then later I tried to get the baby to a baby-sitter
sw4877.dff	51	B	Supposed to be good recommended person from the church and I knew her personally
sw4877.dff	51	B	She had two kids of her own and everything
sw4877.dff	51	B	But I quit my job because I couldn't stand how she was taking care of my child
sw4877.dff	53	B	first of all her children were sick all the time
sw4877.dff	53	B	So when my son stayed over there he got sick
sw4877.dff	54	A	(He) (got) (sick)
sw4877.dff	55	B	same thing that her kids had
sw4877.dff	57	B	And so we didn't take her over there until about eleven o'clock
sw4877.dff	57	B	Then she'd take my son and her daughter over to kindergarten
sw4877.dff	57	B	(But) (s-) (that) (day) (I) (was) (saying) (now) (he's) (sick)
sw4877.dff	57	B	And well she goes he has the same thing that all my kids have
sw4877.dff	57	B	That's what he got (Goes) (okay) so it's not like he's going to infect her kids
sw4877.dff	57	B	But then what happened is I said he just threw up and kindergarten starts at eleven thirty so she said she'll keep him home and he'll probably just sleep anyway
sw4877.dff	59	B	(you) (know) what that woman sent him to kindergarten
sw4877.dff	59	B	(She) (sent) (him) (to) (kindergarten)
sw4877.dff	59	B	As soon as he went there the teacher took one look at him and he threw up again and they put him in the nurse's office
sw4877.dff	60	A	(Guess) (so)
sw4877.dff	61	B	And then what happened is they gave her a call because they knew that she was my baby-sitter
sw4877.dff	61	B	Called her and they said that he's sick
sw4877.dff	61	B	she wasn't home
sw4877.dff	63	B	all her kids were sick but she wasn't home and her daughter that was in kindergarten with him also did not go to school because she was sick
sw4877.dff	63	B	why didn't she keep him home with her
sw4877.dff	63	B	(No) (she) (didn't) (do) (that)
sw4877.dff	63	B	So it got to the point where he's supposed to get out of kindergarten about two thirty
sw4877.dff	63	B	And I had to leave work
sw4877.dff	63	B	it was five o'clock in the evening and I found out he was still there at school
sw4877.dff	63	B	And they were calling me and they said somebody's got to pick him up
sw4877.dff	63	B	And I kept thinking that she was going to pick him up because she only lives like two blocks away from the school
sw4877.dff	63	B	I was trying to get my husband to come and pick him up and all that kind of stuff
sw4877.dff	63	B	And he had a hundred and four fever
sw4877.dff	63	B	They couldn't give him anything because they're not allowed to at school (and) (everything)
sw4880.dff	1	B	(Okay)
sw4880.dff	1	B	I'll let you start (I) (guess)
sw4880.dff	2	A	I'm employed by a company that does do random drug testing and I've got some very definite opinions about it
sw4880.dff	2	A	which haven't changed all that much from my first reactions from when they announced it
sw4880.dff	2	A	But developed a little more (I) (guess) but haven't changed that much
sw4880.dff	2	A	What about you
sw4880.dff	2	A	Are you involved at all
sw4880.dff	3	B	no
sw4880.dff	3	B	I'm not my employer does not do that
sw4880.dff	3	B	although I had an ex-employer that the previous job I used to have (they) I guess a few years after I had started with them they made it a condition of employment that you pass a drug test
sw4880.dff	4	A	(Yes)
sw4880.dff	5	B	(I) (don't) (know)
sw4880.dff	5	B	My feeling is that certain jobs that when there's immediate threat to life and limb if should somebody be under the influence of drugs I'd be willing to support that
sw4880.dff	5	B	For example train engineers
sw4880.dff	7	B	Because (you) (know) (like) there was an incident several years ago where an Amtrak engineer
sw4880.dff	9	B	(he) crashed and killed some people because he was smoking some marijuana and I guess air traffic controllers
sw4880.dff	9	B	I wouldn't want them to be on drugs
sw4880.dff	9	B	And airplane pilots
sw4880.dff	9	B	But in that regard where it's not an immediate threat to life and limb or property
sw4880.dff	11	B	I would seriously question it
sw4880.dff	11	B	(so)
sw4880.dff	12	A	(that's) (mine)
sw4880.dff	12	A	(it) (I) (go) (back) (to) (me) no matter how much our company claims it's not a constitutional issue
sw4880.dff	12	A	(That) because this is between a company and an employee it is not a government it's not the Constitution doesn't apply
sw4880.dff	12	A	But it seems to me that it still should
sw4880.dff	12	A	our company's doing it because they're a government contractor
sw4880.dff	12	A	and so some form of drug program is required to get the government contracts (and) (I'd)
sw4880.dff	13	B	So it's the government that's mandating it to a certain extent
sw4880.dff	14	A	Yes
sw4880.dff	14	A	(Okay)
sw4880.dff	14	A	and our company has taken that and gone all the way
sw4880.dff	14	A	Say okay first off we don't have enough courage to pick out the people that have some sort of indication of possible drug usage because that would offend them if they weren't
sw4880.dff	14	A	So we'll just accuse everybody of using drugs and
sw4880.dff	16	A	make it all even
sw4880.dff	16	A	(and)
sw4880.dff	18	A	(and)
sw4880.dff	19	B	(i-)
sw4880.dff	20	A	(then) (and) (they) so it's a complete random testing well it's random in the sense that you don't know when
sw4880.dff	20	A	It is not random in the sense that they have said that within three years everyone in the company will be tested
sw4880.dff	22	A	and I sit at a terminal and write software all day
sw4880.dff	22	A	it certainly has no life threatening capabilities
sw4880.dff	23	B	(And)
sw4880.dff	24	A	in my job
sw4880.dff	24	A	(and) (yes) (I) (agree) (that) there are jobs that are definitely life threatening and there needs to be a line drawn somewhere reasonable and proper
sw4880.dff	24	A	(I-)
sw4880.dff	25	B	(I) (agree)
sw4880.dff	25	B	(well) (there's) (also) (the) (issue) (of) out here I remember hearing a year or so ago that a lot of there was a high error rate in the analysis of drug results
sw4880.dff	25	B	(or) (I) (shouldn't) (say) (high)
sw4880.dff	27	B	I mean several percent
sw4880.dff	28	A	that I will give credit to our company for in that I think there's a couple of levels of tests in terms of drugs
sw4880.dff	28	A	And essentially the first thing is on the order of paper in the urine (or) (some) it's not quite that simple but it's fairly simple
sw4880.dff	29	B	(Kind) (of) a coarse kind of test
sw4880.dff	30	A	(Coarse) (kind) (of) (test)
sw4880.dff	30	A	And then there's a much more refined test spectrography or whatever it's called
sw4880.dff	30	A	(The) (chemo-)
sw4880.dff	31	B	Is that done
sw4880.dff	32	A	chemotography
sw4880.dff	34	A	to determine exactly what the things are
sw4880.dff	34	A	(And)
sw4880.dff	35	B	Now let me ask you this
sw4880.dff	35	B	at the time you hired on with this company was that prior (to) (any)
sw4880.dff	36	A	No I've been with this company for sixteen years now
sw4880.dff	37	B	(Okay) (so) (that)
sw4880.dff	38	A	(And)
sw4880.dff	39	B	this is obviously not a condition of employment that you subject yourself to this
sw4880.dff	40	A	No
sw4880.dff	40	A	(and) (it) (has) they did that three or four years before they did it with everybody
sw4880.dff	40	A	And at that time I could justify it in terms of someone new coming in you don't know
sw4880.dff	40	A	But on the other hand someone new coming in that knows they're going to have a test
sw4886.dff	1	A	Are you in the middle of anything
sw4886.dff	2	B	No
sw4886.dff	2	B	I'm not in the middle of anything
sw4886.dff	2	B	(I've) (just) about the last thing I did (about) maybe close to a year ago now (I) (guess) I helped my dad add on another bedroom on to his house
sw4886.dff	2	B	So I guess that
sw4886.dff	3	A	The whole thing
sw4886.dff	4	B	that was fairly large undertaking
sw4886.dff	4	B	it's a bedroom and a walk-in closet and a bathroom all on one side of the house
sw4886.dff	5	A	Did the framing and all
sw4886.dff	6	B	we did it all except for the sheetrocking
sw4886.dff	8	B	That was the only thing we didn't putting the ceiling up and things like that we weren't sure how to do (that) (and)
sw4886.dff	9	A	Maybe you and I should get together
sw4886.dff	9	A	Because when I had my last big project I had the contractor do the framing and I did all the sheetrocking and the interior work
sw4886.dff	10	B	that's the exact opposite
sw4886.dff	10	B	We put the roof up and did all the roofing and put all the interior walls up
sw4886.dff	10	B	We just didn't do any of the sheetrock wall work and that's (it) because you have get those joints to go together
sw4886.dff	11	A	(Ye-)
sw4886.dff	12	B	and (whatever) you have to put in there to take the gaps out between the sheets
sw4886.dff	14	B	and on the ceiling (and) (all) (that)
sw4886.dff	14	B	we didn't know a thing about any of that (and) (so)
sw4886.dff	15	A	My wife wishes I hadn't done that
sw4886.dff	18	B	it looked very hard to do (so)
sw4886.dff	20	B	(we) (figured) (just) I didn't think we could do it and make it look professional
sw4886.dff	20	B	So we left it to somebody who does it for a living
sw4886.dff	20	B	(But)
sw4886.dff	21	A	I think it takes about three or four times before it gets easy
sw4886.dff	22	B	(Probably) (so) (and) (I)
sw4886.dff	24	B	we'd never done it so
sw4886.dff	26	B	we just left it alone
sw4886.dff	26	B	But (that's) I guess I'm only twenty-one so my vast experience of home owner's knowledge is not very much
sw4886.dff	26	B	So it's just what I have to do more or less around the house for my parents (so)
sw4886.dff	27	A	Did you framed in new square footage or was it stuff that was already enclosed
sw4886.dff	28	B	It was brand new
sw4886.dff	29	A	(Brand) (new)
sw4886.dff	30	B	We started with the backyard and turned it into part of the house (so) (it) (was)
sw4886.dff	31	A	and you knew how to do the framing
sw4886.dff	32	B	my dad knew how to do most of it
sw4886.dff	34	B	we'd gotten a couple of books and then he just started doing it
sw4886.dff	34	B	I don't know
sw4886.dff	34	B	well he did all the flooring himself
sw4886.dff	34	B	He put the whole floor in and then I just started with the walls and the roof (and) (started) (there)
sw4886.dff	34	B	And then we put (like) (a) not necessarily a garage but just a off the side of that after we had the house part made we just decided we'd carry the roof out a little bit farther and put a carport (more) (or) (less)
sw4886.dff	34	B	(you) (know) it's not enclosed
sw4886.dff	34	B	(It's) just somewhere to drive another car to park (and) (it's)
sw4886.dff	35	A	do you build on slabs down there or did you build it up off the ground
sw4886.dff	36	B	it's off the ground
sw4886.dff	37	A	On the piers
sw4886.dff	38	B	It's on about
sw4886.dff	39	A	(Did)
sw4886.dff	40	B	twenty-two inch piers something like that
sw4886.dff	41	A	You had those poured
sw4886.dff	43	A	or you did them yourself
sw4886.dff	44	B	no (those) (are) we did those ourselves so
sw4886.dff	45	A	You just put forms in the ground and fill them with concrete
sw4886.dff	48	B	Exactly so
sw4886.dff	48	B	(It's)
sw4886.dff	49	A	the last thing I did completely myself was an outside deck which I was pretty proud of
sw4886.dff	50	B	(those) (are) (I've) (done) (one) I helped somebody do one of those before
sw4886.dff	50	B	(those) (are) you can buy them in kits but we didn't do that way
sw4886.dff	50	B	(But) (it's)
sw4886.dff	51	A	No I designed it from scratch and (did) (it)
sw4886.dff	53	A	did a pretty good job
sw4886.dff	53	A	Those are nice
sw4886.dff	53	A	They're pretty forgiving You can always tear stuff out and redo it
sw4886.dff	53	A	(It's) (a)
sw4886.dff	54	B	That's not near
sw4886.dff	56	B	like building a house or anything but
sw4886.dff	58	B	those are nice
sw4886.dff	58	B	Especially when you get done you've got something (I) (don't) (know) I like them
sw4886.dff	58	B	You just sit down on
sw4886.dff	60	B	on the deck and do whatever
sw4886.dff	60	B	Have
sw4886.dff	61	A	(I)
sw4886.dff	62	B	a barbecue (or)
sw4886.dff	63	A	I built it two levels and with a big toy box and some benches and a backrest and all that stuff
sw4886.dff	63	A	(I)
sw4886.dff	64	B	that sounds nice
sw4886.dff	66	B	All done by yourself
sw4886.dff	67	A	I had
sw4886.dff	68	B	(Designed)
sw4886.dff	69	A	a friend with a tractor who dug the pier holes so we could pour concrete and support it with a nice firm four by four posts
sw4886.dff	69	A	And
sw4886.dff	71	A	and then the rest of it I just did
sw4886.dff	71	A	A a contractor friend helped me with some of the foundation work (but) (it) (was) (pretty) it was about four or five hundred square feet
sw4886.dff	71	A	The same size as the addition that I just put on so
sw4886.dff	72	B	that's a good size deck
sw4886.dff	74	B	(So) (That's)
sw4886.dff	75	A	It's not that expensive
sw4886.dff	75	A	I think it cost me three dollars a square foot and no less than that
sw4886.dff	76	B	(That's) (not)
sw4886.dff	77	A	cost me about six hundred dollars all together
sw4886.dff	78	B	that's good
sw4886.dff	78	B	That's not bad at all
sw4886.dff	78	B	(Didn't)
sw4886.dff	80	B	(have) (to) the wood may it got surprising as to the fact that how much wood is to get good lumber it costs I don't know about Dallas but even in this little town it's not cheap at all
sw4886.dff	80	B	I was surprised
sw4886.dff	81	A	I'd be surprised if it wasn't cheaper where you are
sw4886.dff	82	B	It's probably more there
sw4886.dff	83	A	It probably comes from where you are
sw4886.dff	84	B	that
sw4886.dff	85	A	(Most)
sw4886.dff	86	B	it probably does
sw4886.dff	86	B	(I) I'm not sure but
sw4886.dff	87	A	When I drive through that area that's all I see is
sw4886.dff	88	B	It's nothing but woods down here
sw4886.dff	89	A	pressure treated lumber yards
sw4886.dff	92	B	I mean I haven't I used to live in Dallas
sw4886.dff	92	B	In Arlington actually
sw4886.dff	94	B	but that was just when I was a kid so I don't really know what the cost of living is even in Dallas anymore
sw4886.dff	94	B	But I don't know we're a college town so that doesn't help us out any
sw4886.dff	95	A	(East) (Texas)
sw4886.dff	96	B	(We) (have) gas is a dollar twelve a gallon so
sw4886.dff	98	B	that's probably about what you're paying so
sw4886.dff	99	A	my current project is a walkway which I'm building around the house and out to the backyard you know digging it out and laying sand and putting pavers on top of that so
sw4886.dff	101	A	That's a lot easier
sw4886.dff	102	B	You've got something going all the time
sw4890.dff	26	B	they're only going to suffer
sw4890.dff	26	B	they've defeated themselves with their looting and violence
sw4890.dff	26	B	I understand why they were upset by the verdict just (because) (even) those of us that aren't black or don't live there or whatever we all saw the same thing on the tape and
sw4890.dff	27	A	everybody is saying this is going to be a new era and we're going to reexamine this thing
sw4890.dff	27	A	(Hey) the average person is going to take a look at that and say suspicions confirmed
sw4890.dff	27	A	They're a bunch of animals How can you really deal with an environment where you're going to lose everything
sw4890.dff	27	A	(Forty) (deaths)
sw4890.dff	27	A	there are forty people
sw4890.dff	28	B	(I) know
sw4890.dff	29	A	that are dead as a result of that
sw4890.dff	30	B	it's really ridiculous
sw4890.dff	31	A	(And) I'm just trying to determine how you weigh Rodney getting the hell beat out of him against forty deaths
sw4890.dff	32	B	(Against) (forty) (other) (people) (being)
sw4890.dff	33	A	(And) (there's) (no) (other) (I'm) (not) (exactly) (sure) (what) (the) (circumstances) (surrounding) (the) (deaths)
sw4890.dff	33	A	And I'm very upset that the news media has not identified those deaths
sw4890.dff	34	B	(Those) (deaths)
sw4890.dff	35	A	and pursued it because I'm interested in the circumstances surrounding this thing
sw4890.dff	37	A	Is it a looter that got shot by a store owner
sw4890.dff	37	A	(I) no tears
sw4890.dff	38	B	Or just an innocent bystander or somebody got actually beat to death or what
sw4890.dff	39	A	(And)
sw4890.dff	41	A	(and) (so) (I) but (I)
sw4890.dff	43	A	I suspect a number of them
sw4890.dff	43	A	you (you) see film of people being pulled out of a car and shot in (in) the street
sw4890.dff	44	B	or beaten
sw4890.dff	45	A	and my reaction is I would have run over fifty people rather than stop
sw4890.dff	45	A	and there would have been just nothing but carnage (after)
sw4890.dff	47	A	if I'd been at the wheel
sw4890.dff	47	A	No one
sw4890.dff	49	A	would have stopped me
sw4890.dff	50	B	that's exactly how I feel too
sw4890.dff	50	B	they wouldn't have stopped my car for anything had I seen them coming
sw4890.dff	50	B	But I was just wondering since you're back east and a little closer to the bigger cities than we are in Idaho here
sw4890.dff	51	A	I'm inside the beltway
sw4890.dff	53	A	how capital gang they always say inside the beltway they think thus and I say wait a minute (I'm) (inside) (the) (beltway) (and) I don't think like that
sw4890.dff	55	A	I'm a government employee
sw4890.dff	56	B	In what section of the government do you work
sw4890.dff	57	A	I'm with the F B I
sw4890.dff	58	B	(that's) (interesting)
sw4890.dff	59	A	(Yes)
sw4890.dff	59	A	and the reason I'm doing this whole thing is because Rick
sw4890.dff	61	A	whose another government employee wanted segments of my speech
sw4890.dff	63	A	that
sw4890.dff	65	A	(that) were done a year ago and he wanted another collection a year later
sw4890.dff	67	A	And so this is my seventh call
sw4890.dff	67	A	A year ago I did eleven calls
sw4890.dff	68	B	(I) (see)
sw4890.dff	69	A	And so that's why I'm religiously getting on the phone because you know I have a unique situation here (in) (that) (if) (I) (don't) (participate)
sw4902.dff	1	A	And you say you have some strong feelings about the issue
sw4902.dff	2	B	yes I do as far as immigration as a whole goes
sw4902.dff	4	B	I think that we simply must start accepting everybody in the world
sw4902.dff	6	B	(I) there just is not going to be room for all of us
sw4902.dff	6	B	We don't have jobs now
sw4902.dff	6	B	I think when we come to a time of recession that it's particularly important that we shut our doors at that time
sw4902.dff	6	B	I hope you're one of the employed now
sw4902.dff	8	B	I am one of the unemployed now
sw4902.dff	10	B	I was a systems analysis and programmer for an oil company and I applied for one set of jobs with a company here in Dallas that they had two hundred openings but they had two thousand applications
sw4902.dff	12	B	And I know that there are a lot of foreigners here doing my line of work
sw4902.dff	14	B	And of course I'm not perfectly happy about not having a job
sw4902.dff	16	B	how do you feel
sw4902.dff	17	A	I'm a little bit ambivalent
sw4902.dff	17	A	and I think one of the problems with immigration policy is like any other political problem is that people are not willing to discuss it in terms of what really is driving it
sw4902.dff	17	A	They're not willing to tell the truth
sw4902.dff	17	A	The same way with issues of race and things like that
sw4902.dff	17	A	now I believe there are two policies that the government uses to modulate immigration
sw4902.dff	17	A	Three actually
sw4902.dff	17	A	One is at the high end they always want to be able to do some brain draining
sw4902.dff	17	A	They always like to be able to attract the Einsteins or the Professor Chou (or)
sw4902.dff	19	A	They'd like to be able to get the top people in any field and so they can almost always find room for someone like that
sw4902.dff	19	A	At the bottom end they
sw4902.dff	21	A	are always willing to let in cheap labor if it lowers the cost of doing business in some particular area and has strong support from the
sw4902.dff	23	A	powerful people in that area
sw4902.dff	23	A	Those are two things that I think are going on
sw4902.dff	23	A	Although I don't think the politicians would tell you that
sw4902.dff	24	B	Okay and I think you're in both cases
sw4902.dff	25	A	And then the
sw4902.dff	27	A	third thing is the political aspect of letting steam come out from under the lid in Mexico
sw4902.dff	27	A	They cannot close off the Mexican border
sw4902.dff	27	A	Not because it's physically impossible but because the explosion that would take place in Mexico (would) (be)
sw4902.dff	29	A	would spill over to this country so they keep allowing the pressure cooker to let off steam
sw4902.dff	30	B	And I think probably it's pretty important there
sw4902.dff	30	B	How do you feel about Haitian immigration
sw4902.dff	31	A	that's one of the few things (I) (guess) I found myself in agreement with Pat Buchanan
sw4902.dff	31	A	I think they're a very difficult group to integrate into society
sw4902.dff	31	A	(They're) (very) (difficult) (group) to find jobs and places for
sw4902.dff	31	A	And so I don't deny that we may have been involved in causing the problem in that they're pretty miserable where they are
sw4902.dff	31	A	But I'm not to sympathetic about letting large numbers of Haitians in
sw4902.dff	32	B	I feel that if we accepted these people that we would eventually have almost the total population here
sw4902.dff	34	B	And it would have nothing to do with political situations
sw4902.dff	34	B	It would have to do with poverty
sw4902.dff	35	A	But If you let them in a million at a time (you) (know) it wouldn't make that big a bulge in the population
sw4902.dff	35	A	(But)
sw4902.dff	36	B	(my) (gosh)
sw4902.dff	37	A	politically and economically
sw4902.dff	38	B	have you been to southern Florida
sw4902.dff	39	A	I know about it
sw4902.dff	39	A	it is now with Haitians the way it was with Cubans twenty years ago
sw4902.dff	40	B	and the two of them together
sw4902.dff	40	B	(we) (can) it's just as well it's hardly America anymore
sw4902.dff	41	A	On the other hand the ironic thing about this is that there's nobody more full of the entrepreneurial American spirit than our first generation immigrant
sw4902.dff	41	A	So there's a lot to be said for having a steady stream of people who know how it is someplace else coming in
sw4905.dff	1	A	(Okay)
sw4905.dff	1	A	I (just) currently quit my job and so I really don't receive any benefits now
sw4905.dff	3	A	But my husband does and (I) (think) (one) (of) (the) (my) (first) (of) (all) always salary and the second thing is because we have children so it would be health benefits and medical benefits (and)
sw4905.dff	4	B	(Definitely)
sw4905.dff	5	A	and now we have probably some excellent benefits now
sw4905.dff	5	A	We have with Aetna and I don't know if you're familiar with them but we're real happy with them
sw4905.dff	6	B	I've had a variety of different jobs various types in the computer field
sw4905.dff	6	B	And so I've seen a variety of types of benefits
sw4905.dff	6	B	I've worked for awhile and they are a really academic type of place
sw4905.dff	6	B	And then I've worked with regular industry type places
sw4905.dff	6	B	And then with others that are kind of half way between (and) (stuff)
sw4905.dff	6	B	So I've seen a wide range of both nonsalary type benefits (and) (other) (stuff) like health care that's either fully or partially paid and some have bonuses and others have had lots of vacation time but not much other types of benefits and
sw4905.dff	8	B	so I'd say health care is way up there especially anybody with kids
sw4905.dff	10	B	and that's one of the big things that we always look at when I think about changing jobs is what kind of health care they have and does the company pay for it
sw4905.dff	10	B	all or partially or how does that work
sw4905.dff	12	B	And also vacation time too is a big one for me
sw4905.dff	14	B	and (I) (guess) support for (whatever) other
sw4905.dff	16	B	kinds of professional activities you have at work
sw4905.dff	18	B	cause I've
sw4905.dff	20	B	been at places which offer a lot of support and others that don't offer any (and)
sw4905.dff	22	B	(some) (that) sometimes that's coincided with a place that offers more vacation time though so that's not so bad
sw4905.dff	24	B	it's kind of a give and take kind of thing (I) (think)
sw4905.dff	26	B	I say that health care is probably (definitely) number one though
sw4905.dff	26	B	(want) (to) (just) all your salary can't even begin
sw4905.dff	28	B	to pay for what you can wind up losing
sw4905.dff	30	B	in a major illness or something
sw4905.dff	31	A	and another good thing is with the health benefits when they give you more than two choices on who to go with
sw4905.dff	33	A	(And) that really helped us out a great deal
sw4905.dff	33	A	(So)
sw4905.dff	33	A	But my husband does get vacation and it's worked out really good for us too
sw4905.dff	35	A	(So)
sw4905.dff	35	A	(But)
sw4905.dff	36	B	Flexible hours are pretty important to me as well
sw4905.dff	38	B	cause that makes a big difference
sw4905.dff	38	B	My wife works part-time
sw4905.dff	40	B	(And) (she) (works) as a assistant manager in a fabric store
sw4905.dff	42	B	(And) so she works a lot of evenings and weekends and (so) two days a week I manage to get home early enough to meet the kids on the bus
sw4905.dff	42	B	(So) she (you) (know) goes in early those days and works noon til close
sw4905.dff	42	B	(so) (we) (have)
sw4905.dff	43	A	(that's) (great) (that) (you) (all) (can) (work) (that) (out)
sw4905.dff	43	A	(That's) (really) (good)
sw4905.dff	44	B	and being on a rigid schedule there wouldn't be anyway to do that at all
sw4905.dff	46	B	And (I) (think) it's kind of neat to be able to spend the afternoons with the kids occasionally too
sw4905.dff	48	B	usually you go to work before they're awake or as they're getting up for school and you get home and it's already dark unless it's summer time And even in summer time sometimes you get home so late that you know you can't do anything with them
sw4905.dff	50	B	And especially in the winter
sw4905.dff	50	B	you get up in the dark and come home in the dark it's like a vampire sometimes
sw4905.dff	51	A	It's the same with my husband cause he's got pretty flexible hours as long as he puts in the hours he needs to do
sw4905.dff	53	A	Worked out really well for us too
sw4905.dff	55	A	is there anything else that you look for (or)
sw4905.dff	56	B	a lot of (I) (guess) is
sw4905.dff	57	A	you've put a lot of the main points in
sw4905.dff	58	B	(I) (think) (some) (of) (is) (how) (the) (I) (guess) it's not really a direct benefit but how your performance is rated (and) (stuff) (like) (that) at work
sw4905.dff	60	B	Cause I've been especially in large corporations
sw4905.dff	60	B	You can really wind up having real problems I've found out
sw4905.dff	60	B	I've worked for a few several thousand plus type companies
sw4905.dff	62	B	and especially if you're doing professional work
sw4905.dff	62	B	Where you know it's kind of ethereal as to what you're doing
sw4905.dff	64	B	(If) (you're) I work with computer systems a lot
sw4905.dff	64	B	So it's kind of hard to say If you're a brick layer somebody can look and see you laid fifteen thousand bricks today and they were all straight and your building didn't fall down
sw4905.dff	64	B	you did a great job
sw4905.dff	64	B	But if you build computer systems what does that computer program really do Or especially if you write papers
sw4905.dff	66	B	Or do design studies or something
sw4905.dff	66	B	It's real hard to rate something like that
sw4905.dff	68	B	It's like get a painter or something a artist
sw4905.dff	68	B	It's like how do you really rate Michelangelo
sw4905.dff	68	B	How would you tell if he was really good (or) (so-so) (or) (whatever)
sw4905.dff	69	A	And that does make a person want to stay
sw4908.dff	2	A	around here we have a program where we separate the bottles (and) the cans and the plastic stuff from the newspapers
sw4908.dff	2	A	And (we) (keep) the newspapers in a they're collected twice a month and the trash and this bottled stuff that is put in a little blue bin that's picked up and sorted out into a truck
sw4908.dff	2	A	So they actually have about three passes at this collection
sw4908.dff	2	A	(One) (for)
sw4908.dff	3	B	(Sounds)
sw4908.dff	4	A	the regular trash one for the the bottles and cans and one for the newspapers
sw4908.dff	5	B	But I gather you do not separate the bottles and cans
sw4908.dff	6	A	No they do that on the truck
sw4908.dff	8	A	(They) (separate) (them) as they dump them
sw4908.dff	8	A	And one guy comes around with his truck and dumps it all in there
sw4908.dff	8	A	And I think (they're) (running) (out) (of)
sw4908.dff	8	A	The sanitary landfill (I) (think) is running out
sw4908.dff	8	A	Of course you being from New Mexico you've probably been to Washington
sw4908.dff	8	A	Especially if you're your present location
sw4908.dff	9	B	(Yes)
sw4908.dff	10	A	You must have come to Washington at least once
sw4908.dff	11	B	(Yes) (I) (know)
sw4908.dff	11	B	Not only have I come to Washington but I find it very amusing that the thing that was just instituted here is very similar
sw4908.dff	11	B	That is we also have blue bins
sw4908.dff	11	B	We also separate newspapers from all of the other stuff which goes into the bin and gets separated in the truck and landfill space is (in) (deed) the driving factor here
sw4908.dff	11	B	And (in) (fact) despite all of our open space out here landfill space is still very hard to come by
sw4908.dff	12	A	(My) you've got a lot of nothing out there
sw4908.dff	13	B	(A-)
sw4908.dff	14	A	(they) (got) there's got to be a crevice between two mountains that nobody gives a doggone about that you could use for landfill
sw4908.dff	15	B	but if somebody can make a regulation about it they will
sw4908.dff	16	A	what unique things (you) (think) that you can do about it in Los Alamos
sw4908.dff	18	A	other than nuking it
sw4908.dff	19	B	(Yes) (other) (than) (nuking) (it)
sw4908.dff	21	B	(in) (fact) Los Alamos has done a fair amount of research in recycling things in general
sw4908.dff	21	B	it involves for instance creating biological organisms which can remove heavy elements like selenium and barium and other things from waste material in general
sw4908.dff	21	B	and purify the waste of specific nasty elements
sw4908.dff	22	A	that's pretty upscale trash situation
sw4908.dff	22	A	I don't think anybody around here would understand (all) (the)
sw4908.dff	24	A	all those exotic techniques getting
sw4908.dff	25	B	(And)
sw4908.dff	26	A	rid of the heavy metals
sw4908.dff	27	B	the thing that just was in the local news bulletin was somebody made some special polymers that have the ability to make certain actinide elements adhere to them
sw4908.dff	27	B	they've looked at plutonium and uranium and some other similar things (to)
sw4908.dff	29	B	try to remove those from radio active waste and again this is driven by all of the documentation and E S and H considerations that people are worrying about I think much more than they should
sw4908.dff	30	A	(We-)
sw4908.dff	31	B	I've been involved in recycling for long before it became fashionable
sw4908.dff	31	B	Back when I was in graduate school I did all of the recycling of the paper from the computer center and in fact I think I was the first person in our department to have my thesis published on recycled paper
sw4908.dff	34	A	that's certainly getting into the swim of things
sw4908.dff	34	A	(I) (think) it should go to the heart of the matter though and say (okay) (guy) everybody gets five pounds of garbage that they can throw away but more than that every week you've got to pay by the pound
sw4908.dff	34	A	(I) (I) (think)
sw4908.dff	35	B	(I) (think) (that's) (a) (wonderful) (idea)
sw4908.dff	36	A	I (think) people would get very they'd be very careful about how they bought stuff
sw4908.dff	37	B	The only alternative I would see is and this would actually be a little more workable since weighing everybody's garbage would be a real pain
sw4908.dff	37	B	if you did it by volume rather than by weight
sw4908.dff	39	B	it would speak more directly to the space needs and the landfill and it would
sw4908.dff	41	B	also cause people to compact their garbage more
sw4908.dff	43	B	and limiting the volume is probably a little bit closer to the real problem than limiting the weight
sw4908.dff	44	A	(of) (course) (you) (know) those big trucks probably are far more efficient in packing than any kind of little household compactor
sw4917.dff	1	A	an interesting topic
sw4917.dff	2	B	(Yes)
sw4917.dff	4	B	The type of cars that I would be most interested in if I was going to buy another car now would probably be something like a Mazda Miata
sw4917.dff	6	B	(the) I'm very much a fan of sports cars
sw4917.dff	7	A	(Boy)
sw4917.dff	8	B	(The)
sw4917.dff	9	A	you and my husband would have a whole lot in common
sw4917.dff	10	B	(The)
sw4917.dff	12	B	(though) actually (in) (som-) (actually) (if) (I) (h-) (I've) avoided buying a new car for quite some time
sw4917.dff	12	B	I'd rather put my money into
sw4917.dff	14	B	restoring my old cars
sw4917.dff	14	B	I have a old Triumph T R Six
sw4917.dff	16	B	but if I was to buy one probably something like a Miata
sw4917.dff	16	B	(i-) I wouldn't have to worry about it breaking down all the time
sw4917.dff	17	A	(really)
sw4917.dff	19	A	What's the how old is your car
sw4917.dff	20	B	I have a nineteen eighty-five C R X
sw4917.dff	22	B	which is it still works fine
sw4917.dff	24	B	But actually it's kind of annoying cause I've got no reason to replace it
sw4917.dff	26	B	(But)
sw4917.dff	27	A	what do the Miatas run
sw4917.dff	28	B	they're about thirteen to fourteen thousand dollars and a bit more if you add some some options (and) (so) (on) (but)
sw4917.dff	29	A	that's not too bad
sw4917.dff	30	B	(the) that's a pretty good price and
sw4917.dff	32	B	they're so nice to drive
sw4917.dff	33	A	Really
sw4917.dff	33	A	I've never driven one
sw4917.dff	34	B	(it's) (nice)
sw4917.dff	34	B	(They're) I've been down to a dealer and driven them
sw4917.dff	34	B	And I've also driven one at something Mazda put on where they went to autocross events across the country
sw4917.dff	34	B	which is where you race in a parking lot or something like that with a bunch of cones to see who can get through the fastest
sw4917.dff	36	B	about a minute or so
sw4917.dff	38	B	And very twisty stuff
sw4917.dff	38	B	And it handles so nicely
sw4917.dff	39	A	And so you've done this
sw4917.dff	41	A	Okay
sw4917.dff	44	B	it's just so smooth and
sw4917.dff	45	A	(Really)
sw4917.dff	46	B	Nice car
sw4917.dff	46	B	What are you interested in
sw4917.dff	47	A	Whatever my husband buys
sw4917.dff	48	B	you don't get involved in car decisions
sw4917.dff	49	A	not too much
sw4917.dff	49	A	(No)
sw4917.dff	49	A	we just got rid of a full conversion van that wasn't me
sw4917.dff	49	A	That was my husband
sw4917.dff	51	A	He wanted a van and he wanted to drive that van and travel and wanted everything in there
sw4917.dff	51	A	T V the whole bit
sw4917.dff	53	A	But I never drove it so it wasn't me
sw4917.dff	54	B	I can understand
sw4917.dff	54	B	(would)
sw4917.dff	55	A	(And) (then)
sw4917.dff	56	B	(you) (want) if you had to decide what would you want
sw4917.dff	57	A	I'd want a minivan
sw4917.dff	58	B	Okay They're nice
sw4917.dff	59	A	Because I'm with the kids all the time
sw4917.dff	60	B	That's
sw4917.dff	62	B	perfect for that
sw4917.dff	63	A	(And)
sw4917.dff	64	B	it's small enough that it's easy to drive
sw4917.dff	65	A	(You) (pick) (up)
sw4917.dff	66	B	Holds a lot
sw4917.dff	67	A	I pick up my little one from preschool and the whole parking lot's full of minivans
sw4917.dff	69	A	(But) I drive a little Subaru
sw4917.dff	71	A	And I love that
sw4917.dff	71	A	we were going to trade that in for the van but I just wanted to hold on to it (cause) (I) (just) (really) (enjoy) (that)
sw4917.dff	73	A	And (that's) really all I needed was (for) something (just) to go here and there (and) (back)
sw4917.dff	74	B	Minivans are nice
sw4917.dff	74	B	I have a friend who has a minivan
sw4917.dff	76	B	And I've driven it a few times (and) (it's) (nice) (it's) (nice)
sw4917.dff	76	B	Of course my family has always had cars like that
sw4917.dff	76	B	(in) (that) my father's always had a V W bus (every) since
sw4917.dff	77	A	(really)
sw4917.dff	78	B	about nineteen sixty or so
sw4917.dff	79	A	(really)
sw4917.dff	82	B	(they) (he) (used) (it) he often has to transport plants (or) (things)
sw4917.dff	84	B	(like) (that) cause he goes to orchid shows and fills the car with plants
sw4917.dff	84	B	(And) (so) (on) (or)
sw4917.dff	85	A	It's amazing what a minivan can do
sw4917.dff	85	A	We went camping this past weekend with some friends that had a minivan
sw4917.dff	87	A	And pulled the little trailer behind
sw4917.dff	89	A	(The) (pop-up) (trailer)
sw4917.dff	91	A	so it's really amazing (you) (know) what it can do
sw4917.dff	92	B	And they're not that expensive
sw4917.dff	93	A	No they're not
sw4917.dff	95	A	(They're) (probably) ()
sw4917.dff	96	B	Mainly because everyone makes them
sw4917.dff	98	B	You can take your choice of how expensive you want it to be
sw4917.dff	99	A	(And) we do (a) (lot) (of) (driving)
sw4917.dff	99	A	(We) (do) a lot of traveling
sw4917.dff	101	A	By car
sw4917.dff	101	A	And so that's the only time that the conversion van came in handy
sw4917.dff	101	A	But it really didn't cause our kids are still little
sw4917.dff	103	A	So that was the only time we really needed it
sw4917.dff	103	A	Other than that it got terrible mileage (and)
sw4917.dff	104	B	Minivans do pretty well
sw4917.dff	106	B	twenty twenty-five miles per gallon or more
sw4917.dff	108	B	Some of them probably even do thirty
sw4927.dff	2	B	Okay
sw4927.dff	2	B	mandatory service
sw4927.dff	2	B	I don't think it's a good idea because we'd have to change the constitution to allow involuntary servitude in service to the government
sw4927.dff	2	B	And I'm not sure that we could
sw4927.dff	4	B	do that in such a way that we could avoid winding up a slave state
sw4927.dff	6	B	(It's) I like the
sw4927.dff	7	A	(And)
sw4927.dff	8	B	idea
sw4927.dff	9	A	In what way are you talking about
sw4927.dff	10	B	I like the idea of voluntary support
sw4927.dff	12	B	they might be able to say that anyone who does that gets certain benefits that would not be available to someone who didn't do it
sw4927.dff	12	B	But to use force essentially says that there's a title to your body and that title belongs to the government
sw4927.dff	14	B	And you are not a free American
sw4927.dff	16	B	citizen
sw4927.dff	18	B	The idea itself of service is good and when someone is out of high school and not sure about college or out of college and not ready to go into a career and they're not committed to huge amounts of debt that's the best time to be able to do work that doesn't pay very well
sw4927.dff	19	A	(I) And I also thought (that) that would interfere with college work
sw4927.dff	20	B	Unless it were tied
sw4927.dff	21	A	(And) they didn't
sw4927.dff	22	B	directly
sw4927.dff	24	B	if someone were studying something take something obscure
sw4927.dff	24	B	Somebody was studying economics the State Department could offer to send them to the Soviet Union for two years to teach them how to run their country
sw4927.dff	25	A	(That's) (true)
sw4927.dff	26	B	As an extreme example
sw4927.dff	28	B	But in reality I think what you would wind up with is a political football where they would see all these body counts that they can use for their own will and I just don't think it would work
sw4927.dff	29	A	When do they assume this is going to be proposed or mandatory
sw4927.dff	29	A	Or what year are they looking at
sw4927.dff	30	B	they're not
sw4927.dff	30	B	It's been suggested
sw4927.dff	32	B	And it's (sort) (of) a topic of debate
sw4927.dff	34	B	Every time it comes up it gets voted down
sw4927.dff	34	B	The people who are promilitary oppose because they don't want people to have the to opt out of the military into something else
sw4927.dff	36	B	And the people who are proconstitution oppose it on the grounds that the government shouldn't even have (the) to enforce you to join the military unless
sw4927.dff	38	B	the United States is actually under attack
sw4927.dff	40	B	So mostly it's just kind of one of those things that goes away
sw4927.dff	42	B	They've got a noisy line
sw4927.dff	43	A	I thought that was your line
sw4927.dff	44	B	it's somewhere between here and there
sw4927.dff	45	A	what age group are they looking at
sw4927.dff	46	B	eighteen
sw4927.dff	46	B	The draft age
sw4927.dff	47	A	(Eighteen)
sw4927.dff	49	A	(that) (seems) normally that would interfere with college (I) (would) (think)
sw4927.dff	50	B	(Wait) (a) (Let) (me) (see) (if) (I) (can) (get) (on) (a) (cleaner) (line)
sw4927.dff	50	B	(If) (it's) (my) (line)
sw4927.dff	51	A	(I) (moved)
sw4927.dff	51	A	(Maybe) (that's) (part) (of) (it)
sw4927.dff	52	B	(it) (is) (my) (line)
sw4927.dff	52	B	(I) (was) (on) (a) (radio) (phone)
sw4927.dff	54	B	(All) (That's) (better)
sw4927.dff	54	B	now (their) they figure that they can draft you at eighteen
sw4927.dff	54	B	They usually do draft you at nineteen
sw4927.dff	54	B	And that's the
sw4927.dff	56	B	age they're looking at
sw4927.dff	58	B	And of course this one the women would be equally grabbed and they're almost on the verge of saying that if you're going to draft men you're going to have to draft women
sw4927.dff	58	B	And you're going to have to put them in front of the guns just the same
sw4927.dff	60	B	So if you're near that age or you know somebody who is
sw4927.dff	62	B	be aware of that
sw4927.dff	63	A	that's kind of scary
sw4927.dff	65	A	I'm not near that age
sw4927.dff	65	A	I'm way over it but I
sw4927.dff	66	B	(okay)
sw4927.dff	67	A	do have children to think about
sw4927.dff	68	B	And you don't want them sent off to the Middle East to
sw4927.dff	69	A	That's kind of scary
sw4927.dff	70	B	help defend Bush from Saddam after Bush gets done arming him
sw4927.dff	72	B	we only find out about that a year after the fact
sw4927.dff	74	B	So it's another thing
sw4927.dff	74	B	When in doubt don't trust the government at all
sw4927.dff	74	B	It's really reached
sw4927.dff	76	B	that point
sw4927.dff	78	B	you're in Perot country
sw4927.dff	78	B	I'm really thinking that this guy might be good for us
sw4927.dff	79	A	I do too
sw4927.dff	80	B	(I-) it seemed dangerous
sw4927.dff	80	B	I thought is the guy a closet fascist
sw4927.dff	80	B	And then I find out that he helped rid the United States of the gablers
sw4927.dff	81	A	he's helped out in a lot of ways
sw4927.dff	81	A	he's from Dallas
sw4927.dff	81	A	Or he's in the Dallas area
sw4927.dff	83	A	And he's very well known around here
sw4927.dff	83	A	(So)
sw4927.dff	84	B	Okay
sw4927.dff	84	B	I'm in the computer biz too so I know he's well known in the industry
sw4927.dff	86	B	They I have high hopes for him
sw4927.dff	86	B	And I think that if he could get people interested and encouraged and to believe that the government was actually for us then I'm for him
sw4927.dff	87	A	(I)
sw4927.dff	88	B	in the Democratic primary I'm going to vote for Brown just because I kind of like Brown and his attitude
sw4927.dff	88	B	But when it really comes down in the fall I think I know where it's going to go
sw4927.dff	89	A	(I) (think) he's got a very good chance
sw4927.dff	89	A	So there's a lot of people here pulling for him
sw4927.dff	91	A	(So)
sw4927.dff	91	A	(I) (don't) (know)
sw4927.dff	93	A	We'll just see
sw4927.dff	93	A	(How)
sw4927.dff	94	B	(th-)
sw4927.dff	95	A	did you work in the computer business is that what you said
sw4927.dff	96	B	I'm an end user
sw4927.dff	96	B	I teach people how to use MacIntoshes and how to buy equipment and desktop publishing magazine production and things related to that
sw4927.dff	97	A	(okay)
sw4927.dff	97	A	my husband works for Texas Instruments
sw4927.dff	99	A	so that's how we found out about the Switchboard
sw4927.dff	100	B	that's their project too isn't it
sw4927.dff	100	B	I found about it on the network
sw4928.dff	4	B	(I) (need) (to) (get) I'm pretty bad about that
sw4928.dff	4	B	I'm lazy
sw4928.dff	4	B	I should I know I always say that I need to start running and I'm going to try and do that this summer
sw4928.dff	4	B	Because I never have time
sw4928.dff	4	B	I always put it off
sw4928.dff	4	B	By the time I get back from classes it's late at night and I don't feel like going back over to the gym and running on the track or whatever
sw4928.dff	4	B	Because I'm getting a gut here
sw4928.dff	4	B	I got to get back into shape
sw4928.dff	5	A	two years ago I started having trouble with my knee
sw4928.dff	5	A	And (I've) (got) I figured it'll go away
sw4928.dff	5	A	I've had to reduce my program and I've gained fifteen pounds
sw4928.dff	7	A	And so (it's) (e-) I need to get back into swimming instead of running
sw4928.dff	7	A	or I can't run I should be able to swim
sw4928.dff	7	A	I'm such a terrible swimmer and I really feel I can dedicate about an hour and fifteen minutes to this effort
sw4928.dff	7	A	But if it gets longer than that I start not doing anything
sw4928.dff	9	A	so I got a real problem in that regard
sw4928.dff	9	A	(it) (do) you obviously are not an exercise buff or else you'd be out there doing it
sw4928.dff	10	B	(I) (do) (it) (I) (guess) I'm going to do it because I want to get in shape
sw4928.dff	10	B	it's not something I really enjoy all that much that (I'll) (probably) once I get into it and if I get into better shape then it won't be as much of a chore to me
sw4928.dff	11	A	it's always a chore
sw4928.dff	13	A	I started doing this when I was about thirty-five
sw4928.dff	15	A	and now I'm fifty-five
sw4928.dff	17	A	And I just know that I'm going to get blown away with some piece of nonsense
sw4928.dff	17	A	(you) (know) some health related thing is going to blow me away
sw4928.dff	17	A	That's the same way I got too much weight on now
sw4928.dff	17	A	(I)
sw4928.dff	19	A	need to lose fifty pounds I need to lose at least twenty But (it's) (just) I'm busy
sw4928.dff	19	A	I'm doing a lot of traveling and it creates a problem when you're on the road
sw4928.dff	19	A	what other programs other than (say) running
sw4928.dff	19	A	have you ever done anything at all
sw4928.dff	20	B	I have
sw4928.dff	20	B	sit-ups (or) also last summer I was doing Nautilus (or) (last) (year) I'm belong to a club here
sw4928.dff	20	B	Got kind of expensive to renew
sw4928.dff	20	B	They wanted another fifty dollars
sw4928.dff	22	B	That was a little bit too much money
sw4928.dff	22	B	But doing a mix of Nautilus and free weights
sw4928.dff	22	B	I like that
sw4928.dff	23	A	(what) (club) (are) (you) (with)
sw4928.dff	24	B	(I'm) (sorry)
sw4928.dff	25	A	What club were you with
sw4928.dff	26	B	It's called (what) (was) (it) (called)
sw4928.dff	26	B	City Sports downtown Washington
sw4928.dff	27	A	(Okay)
sw4928.dff	27	A	So you're downtown
sw4928.dff	28	B	I go to George Washington University
sw4928.dff	29	A	(Okay)
sw4928.dff	29	A	You're down there on twentieth and eighteenth and
sw4928.dff	31	A	F G
sw4928.dff	32	B	It's Plaza
sw4928.dff	33	A	(I'd) there's a Holiday Spa down there on K street (I) (think)
sw4928.dff	33	A	(Something) (like) (that)
sw4928.dff	33	A	But I go to the Holiday Spa here in Alexandria and that's pretty good
sw4928.dff	33	A	But evening time it gets pretty busy
sw4928.dff	33	A	(But) generally I can get in and get a program
sw4928.dff	35	A	But I need to rededicate myself to doing this and I got a problem ever since my knee went bad of getting back solidly into it
sw4928.dff	35	A	I've been doing this for fifteen twenty years
sw4928.dff	37	A	(you) (know) and I know it's going to bite me in the ass and so I really don't want to back off on it
sw4928.dff	38	B	It's something (I) (think) I'm young I should get started getting into shape
sw4928.dff	38	B	(I) (don't) (want) (to) I want at one point it's going to be too late to do it
sw4928.dff	39	A	no
sw4928.dff	39	A	When you're young
sw4928.dff	41	A	you can abuse all your systems and you can recover
sw4928.dff	43	A	when you get to be my age and you start abusing your systems you get blown away
sw4928.dff	45	A	And just wind up having to kiss your ass good-bye and so the object
sw4936.dff	15	A	(liberated) (it) (after) a (fire) (and) we stripped it all the way down and refinished it and it turned out to be a nice desk
sw4936.dff	17	A	Maple top I think (or)
sw4936.dff	19	A	(something) (of) (that) (sort)
sw4936.dff	20	B	I put together a up rolltop desk from scratch
sw4936.dff	21	A	(really)
sw4936.dff	22	B	(a) (kit)
sw4936.dff	23	A	I'm jealous
sw4936.dff	24	B	Still had to cut it and everything but
sw4936.dff	26	B	it was fun
sw4936.dff	27	A	I do things that might be too crude to be called woodworking
sw4936.dff	27	A	I've built my own deck and
sw4936.dff	29	A	things like that
sw4936.dff	30	B	I've done the same
sw4936.dff	30	B	like the trim around the house
sw4936.dff	31	A	(And)
sw4936.dff	32	B	the baseboards (and) (things) (like) (that)
sw4936.dff	33	A	I definitely have begun to accumulate tools too
sw4936.dff	33	A	(My) (I)
sw4936.dff	35	A	I picked up a bunch of Craftsman tools from the forties that my wife's father owned when he was alive and so I do have a band saw and a router and things like that out in the garage
sw4936.dff	35	A	But I can't say I use them very often
sw4936.dff	36	B	() I'm looking at trying to get a router now
sw4936.dff	37	A	(They're) (handy) (they)
sw4936.dff	39	A	(they) come in handy at the most unusual times
sw4936.dff	39	A	Putting doors in is the time when (I'm) I bought myself a template for making mortices and doors and that's a whole lot easier than doing it with a chisel
sw4936.dff	40	B	(I'll) (bet)
sw4936.dff	41	A	But I've also used them for rabbeting because rabbeting on my radial arm saw is a little bit uncertain
sw4936.dff	43	A	So I got one for Christmas a few years ago and used it quite a bit for the first eight months I had it and now I use it twice a year maybe
sw4936.dff	44	B	my brother's used it a lot for making drawers
sw4936.dff	44	B	I don't
sw4936.dff	45	A	(The) (big)
sw4936.dff	46	B	know what's your opinion of what a good router is like
sw4936.dff	46	B	(I)
sw4936.dff	47	A	(I) (guess) (it)
sw4936.dff	48	B	Because he was tell me (like) the ones that you dial in aren't all that great
sw4936.dff	48	B	They've plastic parts and stuff
sw4936.dff	49	A	The ones that what
sw4936.dff	50	B	That you dial in on the side
sw4936.dff	51	A	I have never even looked at one closely
sw4936.dff	51	A	the
sw4936.dff	53	A	little use that I've gotten from my router I would spend my money on the bits
sw4936.dff	55	A	I have (I'd) (guess) (you'd) (call) a medium quality Craftsman router (and) (the)
sw4936.dff	56	B	How strong is it
sw4936.dff	57	A	It's strong enough for any job where you don't try to take more than (say) three-eighths of an inch at a time
sw4936.dff	57	A	But the problem is that the as with any time you buy a (a)
sw4936.dff	58	B	(Don't) (they)
sw4936.dff	59	A	tool (with)
sw4936.dff	61	A	(a) a (as) (a) as a package
sw4936.dff	63	A	the bits that they give you are low end
sw4936.dff	65	A	(So) (I) (mean) a good set of bits is probably going to run you a hundred dollars and if you're going to use for a lifetime (I) (suppose) it's worth it
sw4936.dff	65	A	(Because) (e-) I imagine if I go and sharpen them myself they won't last
sw4936.dff	65	A	And I've never had the bits sharpened
sw4936.dff	65	A	(So)
sw4936.dff	67	A	That's a thing to consider (is) (to)
sw4936.dff	68	B	they really get hot don't they
sw4936.dff	69	A	And they dull after awhile
sw4936.dff	69	A	Especially I did some cabinets in ash and oak
sw4936.dff	71	A	and that wears a bit down
sw4936.dff	71	A	We remodeled and saved a bunch of really nice ash cabinets
sw4936.dff	73	A	which had been in the original
sw4936.dff	75	A	remodeling of our kitchen
sw4936.dff	77	A	And I saved them and built an oven cabinet out of one and another cabinet out of another by using the faces and so forth
sw4936.dff	77	A	And
sw4936.dff	79	A	routing hardwood will take the edge off a cheap bit pretty fast
sw4936.dff	79	A	(So)
sw4936.dff	80	B	I've cut some one by eight oak before
sw4936.dff	80	B	Boy was that fun
sw4936.dff	81	A	(That's)
sw4936.dff	82	B	Big solid pieces of oak are just
sw4936.dff	83	A	And then you take the blade to the
sw4936.dff	84	B	tough
sw4936.dff	85	A	to get sharpened
sw4936.dff	86	B	that was with a circular saw
sw4940.dff	1	A	(Okay)
sw4940.dff	2	B	Okay Carol
sw4940.dff	2	B	air quality
sw4940.dff	3	A	(Is) (it) I know in here downtown Dallas I mean you drive by and you can see it
sw4940.dff	5	A	But then again I originally was from California and there is a big difference between Texas and California
sw4940.dff	5	A	And
sw4940.dff	6	B	(Surely)
sw4940.dff	7	A	they'd have their smog alerts and where you'd have to stay indoors for so many hours with an air conditioner
sw4940.dff	7	A	And of course they don't have that here in Texas so there's
sw4940.dff	8	B	You mean they don't have the smog alerts
sw4940.dff	9	A	No well not in Dallas that is
sw4940.dff	10	B	(I) (I)
sw4940.dff	12	B	I spent a summer (i-) in Tyler so I know just east of Dallas there
sw4940.dff	13	A	We're going there tomorrow
sw4940.dff	14	B	(really)
sw4940.dff	15	A	We're
sw4940.dff	17	A	packing and getting ready to go to
sw4940.dff	18	B	Actually (I'm) (a) (California) (born) (person)
sw4940.dff	20	B	I was born in L A so I know what you're talking about
sw4940.dff	20	B	In L A it's pretty bad
sw4940.dff	21	A	(okay)
sw4940.dff	21	A	(you) (do) (then)
sw4940.dff	22	B	the worst city in the world is actually Mexico City
sw4940.dff	23	A	Is it really
sw4940.dff	24	B	Yes
sw4940.dff	25	A	(I) (would) (not) (imagine) (that)
sw4940.dff	26	B	The worst one for smog is Mexico City
sw4940.dff	28	B	The most polluted city in the world
sw4940.dff	29	A	(You) (learn)
sw4940.dff	31	A	(something) (every) (day)
sw4940.dff	32	B	I know that they're looking at better running automobiles
sw4940.dff	33	A	(I've) (seen) (that)
sw4940.dff	34	B	some things they do one of them is they're using corn in fuel
sw4940.dff	36	B	You ever heard of that
sw4940.dff	38	B	Methanol
sw4940.dff	39	A	(No)
sw4940.dff	40	B	that's big up here because they grow a lot of corn
sw4940.dff	44	B	that's one thing that they do
sw4940.dff	44	B	(At) (that) it's pretty easy to do
sw4940.dff	46	B	(And) (the) unfortunately it still contributes to global warming cause you have to wipe out forests to grow corn and things like that
sw4940.dff	47	A	(that's) (true)
sw4940.dff	48	B	It doesn't make sense
sw4940.dff	48	B	but it's one of the most productive crop in the world
sw4940.dff	79	A	That would be nice
sw4940.dff	79	A	I think I saw that on T V one time
sw4940.dff	79	A	maybe it was C N N where they were demonstrating that
sw4940.dff	81	A	Or something similar to that
sw4940.dff	82	B	there's a race in Australia with solar powered cars
sw4940.dff	84	B	And Ford and General Motors and all those compete
sw4940.dff	85	A	(But) (w-) I think that was a setback
sw4940.dff	85	A	(That) (I) (don't) (know) they went I don't know how many miles an hour
sw4940.dff	85	A	(I) (think) (twen-) was that something
sw4940.dff	87	A	maybe it was
sw4940.dff	87	A	I don't know
sw4940.dff	88	B	Chrysler announced that well they actually have an electric minivan
sw4940.dff	90	B	their Caravan
sw4940.dff	92	B	But it costs fifty thousand dollars now
sw4940.dff	93	A	and they're very expensive too
sw4940.dff	94	B	To operate But people are buying them
sw4940.dff	94	B	You know whose buying them
sw4940.dff	94	B	The power company
sw4940.dff	96	B	(you) (know) free for them
sw4940.dff	98	B	Kind of interesting (so) (see)
sw4940.dff	99	A	it doesn't make sense
sw4940.dff	99	A	Because if they want people to convert
sw4940.dff	101	A	They should make it worthwhile
sw4940.dff	102	B	It's top speed is something like eighty miles an hour
sw4940.dff	102	B	So it's
sw4940.dff	104	B	a good
sw4940.dff	106	B	vehicle
sw4940.dff	107	A	I'll tell you
sw4940.dff	109	A	Sometimes it's pretty bad here
sw4940.dff	109	A	today I think it was pretty bad
sw4940.dff	109	A	I don't know if it's just the allergies or what but
sw4940.dff	111	A	some days it's very nice here downtown and other days it's just really bad so I don't know
sw4940.dff	111	A	So what kinds of things did you experience in L A when you were there
sw4940.dff	111	A	Or can you remember
sw4940.dff	111	A	(Were) (you) (there) (at) (a)
sw4940.dff	112	B	I wasn't there too long ago
sw4940.dff	113	A	(Cause) (I) (haven't) (been) (there) (probably)
sw4940.dff	114	B	going over the hills coming into the valley
sw4940.dff	116	B	You can see that horrible horrible brown haze
sw4940.dff	117	A	we were there when they had a
