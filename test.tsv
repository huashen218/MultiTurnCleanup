sw4004.dff	2	B	(I) (guess) it's pretty deep feelings I just went back and rented the movie (what) (is) (it) GOOD MORNING VIET NAM
sw4004.dff	4	B	and
sw4004.dff	5	A	(I) (saw) (that) (as) (well)
sw4004.dff	6	B	Got some insight there to kind of help me put together the feelings
sw4004.dff	6	B	I really appreciated the whole English class where the fellow just wouldn't do it the guy's gouging your eyes out what are you going to do
sw4004.dff	8	B	what for him to finish me off
sw4004.dff	10	B	And it was good to remember that kind of Asian philosophy
sw4004.dff	11	A	were
sw4004.dff	12	B	(that)
sw4004.dff	13	A	you ever in Viet Nam (or)
sw4004.dff	14	B	No (no) I was kind of an in-between finally drew a high draft number and you
sw4004.dff	15	A	I was much too young I was born in sixty-seven (so)
sw4004.dff	17	A	(well) both my brothers were draft age but neither of them wound up going over which I think they were very happy for
sw4004.dff	18	B	personally I just went in limbo
sw4004.dff	18	B	I had a passport and was ready to go
sw4004.dff	20	B	out of the country or
sw4004.dff	22	B	join special forces either one
sw4004.dff	24	B	I just didn't know
sw4004.dff	24	B	(So)
sw4004.dff	25	A	so do you feel that it was worth what we did over there
sw4004.dff	26	B	(just) (a) (second)
sw4004.dff	27	A	(Okay)
sw4004.dff	28	B	(Okay)
sw4004.dff	28	B	(Sure) Mark what was that again
sw4004.dff	29	A	I mean do you think the investment in lives and money was worth it
sw4004.dff	30	B	No not really
sw4004.dff	31	A	(I) (totally) (agree) (with) (that)
sw4004.dff	33	A	what effects do you think it's had on our country
sw4004.dff	34	B	Downside
sw4004.dff	34	B	the says we should go into the grief that's there and presidents have always avoided that
sw4004.dff	36	B	as a country
sw4004.dff	36	B	So it's pretty serious really lot of things that aren't being addressed
sw4004.dff	37	A	(I) (think) that's pretty typical of the entire involvement over (you) (know) that nothing was really addressed (you) (know) it was never we announced that we were going to war it was such a gradual and subtle
sw4004.dff	39	A	you know increasement of force that
sw4004.dff	40	B	Gulf of Tonkin resolution and was it a dolphin or a torpedo
sw4004.dff	40	B	You remember that
sw4004.dff	41	A	I vaguely remember we had a spy ship torpedoed (or) (something)
sw4004.dff	42	B	only it was foggy and finally President Johnson said they're weren't really sure whether it was a dolphin or a torpedo
sw4004.dff	44	B	Isn't that something
sw4004.dff	45	A	so do you think that for example in this past war in the Persian Gulf war
sw4004.dff	47	A	(you) (see) it seemed (to) (me) that Bush was going to extraordinary lengths to prepare the country for war
sw4004.dff	48	B	Hey Mark
sw4004.dff	50	B	I've got to go
sw4004.dff	51	A	(Okay)
sw4004.dff	52	B	We'll see you
sw4004.dff	52	B	(I) (guess) our five minutes are up according to me
sw4004.dff	52	B	Are they to you
sw4004.dff	53	A	I wasn't really keeping count
sw4004.dff	53	A	But (I) (guess) good-bye
sw4004.dff	54	B	(okay) bye-bye
sw4004.dff	55	A	Bye
sw4008.dff	1	A	do you have a P C
sw4008.dff	2	B	Yes I have a Macintosh S E thirty
sw4008.dff	3	A	a lot of my friends are into Macintoshes
sw4008.dff	3	A	I have a I B M P C myself
sw4008.dff	5	A	A two eighty-six
sw4008.dff	5	A	I'm probably eventually going to get a three eighty-six
sw4008.dff	6	B	What do you use yours for mostly
sw4008.dff	7	A	mostly word processing applications and just as a dumb terminal
sw4008.dff	9	A	but I think eventually I'll start using it for spreadsheets and things like that
sw4008.dff	9	A	what do you find that you use yours mostly for
sw4008.dff	10	B	I do a lot of word processing (and) spreadsheets and data base and (about) (the) (only) (thing) I'm just starting to get into a little bit more communications now
sw4008.dff	10	B	I've just today ordered a fax modem so I'll be able to
sw4008.dff	12	B	send and receive faxes over there (without) (using) you don't have to make a hard copy that way
sw4008.dff	14	B	are you using windows
sw4008.dff	15	A	No I think I'm planning on moving up getting a three eighty-six before I move up to windows
sw4008.dff	17	A	although I do like the graphical user environment
sw4008.dff	18	B	it's getting to be more and more like a Macintosh
sw4008.dff	19	A	(it's) I just want it more for multi tasking which I suppose is also like a Macintosh
sw4008.dff	22	B	(the) (one) (thing) (I) (used) (to) (use) (a) I've never used an I B M actually
sw4008.dff	22	B	I used to use just an Apple two E which of course (is)
sw4008.dff	24	B	looks pretty primitive now
sw4008.dff	25	A	that's what I learned a lot of languages on was an Apple two E in my high school
sw4008.dff	26	B	But I don't have any real programming capabilities on my Mac now
sw4008.dff	28	B	I don't have any compilers
sw4008.dff	30	B	(so) (I'm)
sw4008.dff	31	A	do you use your computer for (just) things around the house (or) (in) (the) ()
sw4008.dff	32	B	I use it in my business
sw4008.dff	33	A	what do you do
sw4008.dff	34	B	I do consultation and testing of various kinds for English as a second language programs
sw4008.dff	35	A	wow
sw4008.dff	35	A	and (do) these programs are they based on a other language (or) (are) (they) (based) (you) (know) a lot of the English as a second language classes will have people from all sorts of parts of the world and the teacher just tries to teach English through natural understanding
sw4008.dff	36	B	that's the kind of thing I'm working with exactly
sw4008.dff	38	B	You seem to be better informed than the average person on that
sw4008.dff	39	A	(it) (was) (just) when I was high school I worked for the community school and they had a English second language class and it always seemed strange to me that all these people that spoke English not too well and spoke a variety of different languages were all being taught at the same time
sw4008.dff	41	A	I imagine it's a lot harder on a computer because (you) (know) you don't have as many cues you don't have hand gestures and things like that
sw4008.dff	42	B	now (we) what I use a computer for is to write materials that
sw4008.dff	44	B	are later printed though
sw4008.dff	44	B	Most of the stuff that I do is not interactive
sw4008.dff	46	B	and I use it for data analysis on testing (so)
sw4008.dff	47	A	to see how well they retain the vocabulary and things like that
sw4008.dff	48	B	actually just item analysis statistical analysis of the tests
sw4008.dff	50	B	when you write a test you have to look at some data from it and see how the different questions are performing
sw4008.dff	52	B	and find out which ones are discriminating well and which ones aren't
sw4008.dff	54	B	find out how reliable the test is you try correlate it with other tests (and) (things) (of) (that) (sort)
sw4008.dff	54	B	(So) it's involves a lot of spreadsheet use
sw4008.dff	55	A	(I) (would) (imagine) (so)
sw4008.dff	55	A	(so) what were you doing when you were using an Apple two E
sw4008.dff	56	B	I was doing some of the same stuff but doing it more slowly
sw4008.dff	58	B	and with smaller files
sw4008.dff	58	B	I can't believe I've got five megabytes on this one now
sw4008.dff	59	A	(it's)
sw4008.dff	60	B	and on my two E I had a hundred twenty-eight K
sw4008.dff	61	A	Yes it's amazing how in the general user community the expectations have just grown so much
sw4008.dff	61	A	I remember my first computer was a T R S eighty with four K on it
sw4008.dff	63	A	and then I started playing with Apples and those had forty-eight or if they were really great
sw4008.dff	64	B	(the) (old)
sw4008.dff	65	A	they had sixty-four K
sw4008.dff	66	B	the old Apple the (the) original Apple had (what) forty-eight (I) (guess) didn't it
sw4008.dff	67	A	(I) (know)
sw4008.dff	69	A	(I) (know) that in my school they had a bunch that had sixteen K on them is all (and)
sw4008.dff	70	B	(My) (goodness)
sw4008.dff	71	A	I remember that there was one game that I played that required forty-eight K and there was only one computer that had forty-eight K on it at the time
sw4008.dff	73	A	And it's just so amazing that generally if you I'm not sure about Macintoshes but I know I B M -s (you) (know) you buy a megabyte at a time
sw4008.dff	75	A	that's the low end
sw4008.dff	76	B	the S P thirty goes up to eight
sw4008.dff	78	B	but I haven't upgraded it quite that far yet
sw4008.dff	78	B	I think probably when I get system seven I may have to do that and get possibly another hard disk
sw4008.dff	78	B	(I) (don't) (know)
sw4008.dff	78	B	They say that system seven uses a lot of memory
sw4008.dff	79	A	(I) (imagine)
sw4013.dff	1	A	(Okay) so you have eight children
sw4013.dff	1	A	what type of things do you do as a family to spend time together
sw4013.dff	2	B	we spend a lot of time outdoors jogging bicycling going to the park some time watching V C R
sw4013.dff	4	B	movies
sw4013.dff	6	B	generally cheap things
sw4013.dff	7	A	we know how that goes
sw4013.dff	7	A	with lots of kids you don't have lots of money for recreation
sw4013.dff	8	B	(That's)
sw4013.dff	9	A	that's fun
sw4013.dff	9	A	So let's see some of the things we do together as a family we like to play games a lot and you may think this is funny but one of our funnest games we like to play together is hide and seek and we just have a hoot playing hide and seek when it's dark
sw4013.dff	11	A	in our house and that is so fun
sw4013.dff	11	A	The kids just get a crack out of that
sw4013.dff	11	A	we do like to go to the park too like your family
sw4013.dff	11	A	we don't do a lot of vacationing
sw4013.dff	11	A	Have you taken a lot of vacations together (or)
sw4013.dff	12	B	Most of our vacations are to go and see Grandma and Grandpa
sw4013.dff	13	A	(and) (whe-)
sw4013.dff	14	B	We get an occasional one or two day thing
sw4013.dff	16	B	but most of them are going and seeing Grandma and Grandpa
sw4013.dff	17	A	now where do they live
sw4013.dff	18	B	In Arizona
sw4013.dff	19	A	so that's a bit of a drive for you there
sw4013.dff	20	B	Yes
sw4013.dff	21	A	so you like to go there for the holidays (and)
sw4013.dff	22	B	we don't go very often for holidays
sw4013.dff	22	B	Generally we try to get all of our kids back home for the holidays
sw4013.dff	24	B	and let Grandma and Grandpa come and visit us
sw4013.dff	25	A	what are the ages of your kids then
sw4013.dff	26	B	They range from twenty-four to five
sw4013.dff	27	A	So you have some in the nest and some out
sw4013.dff	28	B	(That's)
sw4013.dff	30	B	How old are your children
sw4013.dff	31	A	(We) (have) ours start at twelve and then they go down to four
sw4013.dff	32	B	I think the hardest thing for us is to find you know leisure time activities that all of our kids can enjoy together
sw4013.dff	33	A	(I) (bet)
sw4013.dff	34	B	with the age span (that) we have the older kids love playing board games (and) (that) (kind) (of) (thing)
sw4013.dff	36	B	but the young kids don't understand it
sw4013.dff	37	A	(Yes)
sw4013.dff	38	B	(and) so they get real frustrated when we try to do that (and)
sw4013.dff	39	A	Yes (and) (then) if you want to play something on the little kids' level (then) the older kids get (real) bored and (they) want to do something else
sw4013.dff	39	A	(So)
sw4013.dff	41	A	I can relate to that
sw4013.dff	41	A	do you feel that the current trend in families spending time together is (a) positive (one) or (a) negative (one)
sw4013.dff	42	B	I think it's improving (actually)
sw4013.dff	44	B	We had an interesting experience the other day
sw4013.dff	44	B	(we) (have) pretty much (a) (routine) (that) (we) (spend) we don't have our kids play with other kids on Sunday
sw4013.dff	46	B	(and) we (just) (kind) (of) keep them at home
sw4013.dff	48	B	(and) (our) (next) (door) (neighbor) we were at a soccer game Saturday and our next door neighbor was there (and) somebody came up and asked if their daughter could spend Saturday night at their house
sw4013.dff	50	B	and she said no Sunday's our family day
sw4013.dff	52	B	(and) we keep our kids at home so we can spend time with them
sw4013.dff	53	A	(That's) (good)
sw4013.dff	54	B	(And) I think those kinds of things are happening a lot where we are now
sw4013.dff	55	A	(good)
sw4013.dff	56	B	I think it's gone to one extreme where the families were (just) running all different direction
sw4013.dff	58	B	(and) I think more people are interested in spending time with their kids now
sw4013.dff	59	A	(I) (think) (so) and (I) (feel) (you) (know) like President Bush has mentioned quite often that we are trying to become a kinder and gentler nation and it does begin with the families at home
sw4013.dff	61	A	and so I'm a firm believer in that too
sw4013.dff	62	B	I think a lot of people are panicked how kids are turning out and how things are going for kids and realizing they've got to start doing something
sw4013.dff	62	B	(So)
sw4013.dff	63	A	(Yes) (that's) (true)
sw4013.dff	63	A	we see that a lot out here in Utah and hopefully it's going to spread
sw4013.dff	64	B	Utah's a lot better than Texas
sw4013.dff	65	A	do you have a lot of large families out there in Texas (or)
sw4013.dff	66	B	Very few
sw4013.dff	67	A	(Very) (few)
sw4013.dff	67	A	You feel like you're in the minority
sw4013.dff	68	B	definitely
sw4013.dff	70	B	When we tell people how many kids we have they look at us like we didn't have good sense
sw4013.dff	71	A	(dear)
sw4013.dff	72	B	(But)
sw4013.dff	73	A	out here in Utah five is about the
sw4013.dff	74	B	Average
sw4013.dff	75	A	the average
sw4013.dff	76	B	My wife and I were in Utah until
sw4013.dff	78	B	I guess we were about twenty-four
sw4013.dff	80	B	Never been back since then (but)
sw4013.dff	82	B	We have kids up there now so we get up occasionally
sw4013.dff	83	A	I have some relatives out there in Texas in fact my mom's out there in Texas now in Dallas spending a month with her cousins on their ranch (and)
sw4013.dff	84	B	where in Dallas
sw4013.dff	85	A	(no) (I'm) (trying) Aberdeen
sw4013.dff	87	A	is that close to Dallas
sw4013.dff	88	B	I don't have any idea
sw4013.dff	88	B	I've never
sw4013.dff	90	B	heard of it
sw4013.dff	90	B	Must be a
sw4013.dff	91	A	(Don't) (you)
sw4013.dff	92	B	little town
sw4013.dff	93	A	I guess it's out there clear out
sw4013.dff	93	A	They have a ranch that has like five hundred acres (and)
sw4019.dff	24	B	Two years
sw4019.dff	25	A	and he was so mean to her after we first got him
sw4019.dff	25	A	we had him neutered and declawed and now he bites her
sw4019.dff	25	A	He can't
sw4019.dff	27	A	scratch her any more he bites her
sw4019.dff	28	B	Does he bite her enough to draw blood
sw4019.dff	29	A	he has a couple of times so
sw4019.dff	31	A	But he's a very possessive cat
sw4019.dff	31	A	he loves my son it's his cat and he's the only one that allows him to touch him or pet him or love him
sw4019.dff	33	A	and he's so funny he (just) follows my son around just like a dog
sw4019.dff	35	A	He won't even let my son shower
sw4019.dff	37	A	He meows and wants to get in the bathroom (and) while he showers it's so hilarious
sw4019.dff	37	A	So he's quite a animal
sw4019.dff	38	B	(boy) (I) (guess)
sw4019.dff	38	B	as long as he doesn't get too aggressive
sw4019.dff	38	B	I guess with the daughter he's all
sw4019.dff	40	B	You wouldn't want him to carry her off or something
sw4019.dff	41	A	we did actually take him to the pound a couple of times
sw4019.dff	43	A	because we just couldn't have him being
sw4019.dff	44	B	(Sure)
sw4019.dff	45	A	so aggressive towards the girl but he seems to have mellowed out a little bit and we do keep our daughter away from him
sw4019.dff	45	A	So
sw4019.dff	47	A	Were it not for my son the cat would not be in this house
sw4019.dff	48	B	Is that the only pet that you have
sw4019.dff	49	A	It is we tried a dog about four years ago and we ended up with malamute and some other kind of mix
sw4019.dff	49	A	Anyway it ended up being just a huge dog that ate us out of house and home
sw4019.dff	49	A	So we gave him up (and) (tried)
sw4019.dff	50	B	do you live in a house (or) (a) (place) (where) (you)
sw4019.dff	51	A	Yes we're in a house but we're in a subdivision
sw4019.dff	52	B	(I) (see)
sw4019.dff	53	A	where we really can't allow the dog (we) (couldn't) (allow) (him) to run free so he was just chained up all the time and it was
sw4019.dff	54	B	(Sure)
sw4019.dff	55	A	unfortunate
sw4019.dff	55	A	have you tried any other pets
sw4019.dff	56	B	No (no)
sw4019.dff	56	B	I live alone in an apartment and it's not that big that
sw4019.dff	58	B	although I've heard rabbits are pretty good
sw4019.dff	60	B	I saw something on C N N or on cable here
sw4019.dff	62	B	a while ago that showed some people that had rabbits in apartments
sw4019.dff	63	A	(my) (word)
sw4019.dff	64	B	and in houses and (they) apparently (especially) when they're young when they bring them in
sw4019.dff	65	A	(my) (word)
sw4019.dff	66	B	()
sw4019.dff	67	A	And do they just paper train it (or) (something)
sw4019.dff	68	B	I guess
sw4019.dff	70	B	(I) (guess) and I would imagine that they don't have many more than one to start with either
sw4019.dff	71	A	rabbits are darling
sw4019.dff	71	A	That would be fun if you could get them trained
sw4019.dff	71	A	Otherwise they're pretty smelly
sw4019.dff	72	B	(that's)
sw4019.dff	74	B	Did you see the C N N the dog show
sw4019.dff	75	A	we don't have cable
sw4019.dff	76	B	I see
sw4019.dff	76	B	(they) (have) they call it the Westminster Dog Show I think it's in New York City at the Gardens there once a year live
sw4019.dff	78	B	and they had that on last week and that's really kind of something
sw4019.dff	80	B	to watch it's on I think two or three nights for maybe an hour or two
sw4019.dff	81	A	(Is) (that)
sw4019.dff	82	B	and some of the weirdest animals you ever want to see in there
sw4019.dff	84	B	Some of them are really beautiful too
sw4019.dff	87	A	(I'd) (be) (interesting) (to) (watch)
sw4019.dff	88	B	you live in Utah do you
sw4019.dff	89	A	Yes Elton
sw4019.dff	90	B	(Goodness)
sw4019.dff	91	A	We live out here it's by Ogden
sw4019.dff	91	A	It's north of Salt Lake City Utah
sw4022.dff	1	A	I don't know
sw4022.dff	1	A	I think the budget is really out of hand now and especially in this election year I think that there ought to be at least some conversation about what
sw4022.dff	3	A	we are supposed to do about this
sw4022.dff	4	B	it kind of seems to me that everyone's offering their token little tax cut program when it's
sw4022.dff	6	B	(when) (it's) just such a bad time for it
sw4022.dff	7	A	and as you said mostly they are token cuts
sw4022.dff	9	A	especially what for instance George Bush is offering
sw4022.dff	10	B	The ninety-seven cents a week
sw4022.dff	11	A	(ninety-seven) (cents) (a) (week)
sw4022.dff	11	A	(what) that's really not going to do a lot of good it doesn't seem to me to your average
sw4022.dff	13	A	middle income person Another ninety-seven cents hell you can buy a coke or something for that
sw4022.dff	14	B	(mostly) it's not actually a cut it's just a cut in the amount withheld
sw4022.dff	16	B	I don't see this changing my lifestyle a whole lot
sw4022.dff	17	A	That ninety-seven cents really isn't going to do it for me either
sw4022.dff	19	A	I haven't really heard much of what the other candidates have said that have made a lot of sense to me either especially the Democratic candidates don't seem to be coming up with much that really sparks my interest as far as maybe that could do something to affect our budget
sw4022.dff	21	A	at this point
sw4022.dff	22	B	in retrospect was it Mondale or Dukakis that said I'll tell you now I'm going to raise taxes
sw4022.dff	23	A	(I) (believe) (it) (was) (Dukakis)
sw4022.dff	24	B	It was Dukakis
sw4022.dff	25	A	(but) (I) (can't)
sw4022.dff	26	B	I have a lot of respect for him
sw4022.dff	27	A	that's better than George Bush who came out and said No I will not
sw4022.dff	29	A	read my lips (or) (whatever)
sw4022.dff	31	A	and then ten months later he said sorry I (I) can't follow through on this
sw4022.dff	33	A	But it seems to me that the budget is so out of hand and especially now that they say Okay the cold war is over and we're supposed to be getting a peace dividend of
sw4022.dff	35	A	(of) X number of (billion) trillion dollars a year
sw4022.dff	35	A	I'd really like to know where that money is actually going to go because in my opinion I don't think I'm ever going to see any of this (peace) so-called peace dividend
sw4022.dff	36	B	(it's)
sw4022.dff	37	A	if they could actually put something together (and) (make) I'm not really in favor of large government social programs either because I feel that they waste
sw4022.dff	39	A	money also but with this peace dividend it seems like you could set up some kind of
sw4022.dff	41	A	public works projects like they had in the thirties (or) (whatever)
sw4022.dff	42	B	I think that would be a great idea like the conservation corps (where)
sw4022.dff	43	A	(ex-)
sw4022.dff	44	B	it would help unemployment greatly
sw4022.dff	45	A	(Exactly)
sw4022.dff	46	B	(And) (it)
sw4022.dff	47	A	and in that way we could really focus on building the infra structure of the country
sw4022.dff	48	B	(infra) (structure) (is) (in) we have hurt ourselves incredibly last fifty years in the
sw4022.dff	49	A	(and)
sw4022.dff	50	B	cold war
sw4022.dff	51	A	and there's no way that we can ever really recover from (from) the state that we're in now unless (at) (least) (I) (feel) (unless) we focus on the infra structure and I surely don't hear anybody saying that now
sw4022.dff	52	B	(I) (agree) (totally)
sw4022.dff	54	B	it just seems (you) (know) so ridiculous that it was allowed to happen
sw4022.dff	54	B	I'm in college now (and)
sw4022.dff	55	A	So am I
sw4022.dff	56	B	(really) where do you go
sw4022.dff	57	A	I U
sw4022.dff	58	B	I go to Georgia Tech
sw4022.dff	60	B	And in (what) (I) (had) (you) (know) the required political science class
sw4022.dff	62	B	a couple of years ago
sw4022.dff	62	B	And one of the things we discussed was how the budget situation just got so out of hand
sw4022.dff	64	B	And essentially what happened was I think it was like in the tax year of eighty-one Ronald Reagan basically said I'm going to give this much of a tax cut to the tax payers and created this ludicrous budget that he knew that the Congress would not in their mind pass
sw4022.dff	66	B	and the Democratic Congress realized that they were going to lose a propaganda war you know bye-bye removing the tax cut
sw4022.dff	68	B	further cut the taxes and (you) (know) created the huge deficit that year which moved us into the trillion dollar deficit
sw4022.dff	70	B	(And) (you) (just) ()
sw4022.dff	71	A	you just have to wonder what they're thinking in Washington
sw4022.dff	72	B	it's just like they're playing chicken with a loaded gun
sw4022.dff	73	A	(it's) (more) (than) (a) (loaded) it's a loaded cannon
sw4022.dff	75	A	they've got trillions of dollars to spend every year and they in my opinion don't do a very responsible job
sw4022.dff	77	A	(of) (spending) (that) (money)
sw4022.dff	78	B	what really bothers me is it just seems like if anyone were to say I'm going to raise taxes and cut the budget and we're going to have to do some unpopular things he wouldn't have a chance of getting elected
sw4022.dff	79	A	(no)
sw4022.dff	80	B	it's kind of like Rome and the bread and circuses thing
sw4022.dff	82	B	where people just want to have whatever will make them feel good now
sw4022.dff	83	A	for the moment and that's what really is getting me about what George Bush's stand on the budget is now
sw4022.dff	85	A	is that he is saying I am going to give you this ludicrous little tax cut so that you'll be happy come November and you'll elect me again
sw4022.dff	87	A	and then I'm going to go on and just forget everything that I said
sw4022.dff	89	A	or it doesn't seem that it's going to make much of a difference
sw4022.dff	90	B	(It) I don't know I don't think George Bush will make the American people happy with ninety-seven cents a week
sw4022.dff	91	A	No (no) not at all
sw4022.dff	92	B	I just don't think it was a well thought out incentive
sw4022.dff	93	A	(No)
sw4023.dff	1	A	how do you feel about crime in the city
sw4023.dff	1	A	You say you're from Atlanta
sw4023.dff	2	B	actually I live in the city
sw4023.dff	4	B	and (I) (guess) it is a concern of mine for my own safety
sw4023.dff	5	A	do you find crime in Atlanta really I live in Atlanta also
sw4023.dff	6	B	that's
sw4023.dff	8	B	I think it is bad in certain areas however (I) (think) the area that I live in the crime level is not as high as it is in other areas of the city
sw4023.dff	10	B	(I) (think) it seems that there's certain areas where the crime is focused
sw4023.dff	13	A	what do you think can be done about the crime in the city
sw4023.dff	14	B	I think what's been happening over the last several years it seems they've been beefing up the police patrols trying to put more guys more cops higher visibility and
sw4023.dff	16	B	they've had some impact but not a tremendous amount and probably they need to try to increase community involvement (that) (sort) (of) (thing) (I) (think) ()
sw4023.dff	17	A	(I) (probably) (agree) (with) (that)
sw4023.dff	20	B	particularly in some of the housing projects that tends to be where a lot of that crime is focused
sw4023.dff	22	B	and they've got to do more than just having cops there
sw4023.dff	22	B	They've got to kind of change the way people think about it
sw4023.dff	23	A	(that's) (probably) (true)
sw4023.dff	23	A	so do you think Atlanta's as bad as most other cities
sw4023.dff	24	B	(I've) (been) (to) I'd say it's probably in the top ten in terms of crime
sw4023.dff	24	B	it's nowhere near as bad as New York City
sw4023.dff	26	B	for example
sw4023.dff	26	B	Probably not as bad as Detroit
sw4023.dff	27	A	I don't think it's as bad as L A either
sw4023.dff	28	B	No
sw4023.dff	29	A	I don't think we have as much of the gang problem as a lot of the other cities have
sw4023.dff	30	B	that seems to be true
sw4023.dff	30	B	if you've ever been to New York City and
sw4023.dff	32	B	as you walk through the street on a given evening you can see crimes being committed
sw4023.dff	34	B	It's that obvious
sw4023.dff	35	A	(I) (don't) (know) I came to the conclusion also that if you are walking in a downtown area where there's a lot of crime a lot of that's going to just keeping your senses about you and trying not to look like a victim
sw4023.dff	36	B	(that's) (true)
sw4023.dff	37	A	(walk) (bi-) (walk) (with) with
sw4023.dff	38	B	With a big stick (or)
sw4023.dff	39	A	just walk in (a) confidently and don't don't be
sw4023.dff	41	A	looking around like you've never been there before
sw4023.dff	42	B	(Sure)
sw4023.dff	43	A	and you have no idea where you are
sw4023.dff	44	B	don't walk down an alley (or) (don't) (get)
sw4023.dff	46	B	just try to keep yourself out of a bad situation
sw4023.dff	48	B	(but) there are times when you can't avoid (all) that
sw4023.dff	50	B	and (then) you're (kind) (of) on your own
sw4023.dff	51	A	have you ever been mugged in Atlanta
sw4023.dff	52	B	no
sw4023.dff	52	B	The only thing I've ever had was (I've) (had) my wallet lifted
sw4023.dff	54	B	but that was in (a) more of a setting where there was a number of people around (and) (I) (kind) (of) (got) I was much younger at the time
sw4023.dff	56	B	and (kind) (of) a couple of people (they) just took it (from) me without me knowing (really)
sw4023.dff	58	B	and (kind) (of) passed it off so I didn't know who had it
sw4023.dff	60	B	(I've) (had) (that) (happen) but that's about it
sw4023.dff	61	A	I've been pretty lucky about getting mugged
sw4023.dff	63	A	I think I've only actually seen (you) (know) one actual robbery with a gun
sw4023.dff	65	A	and that's been (about) the only (you) (know) potentially violent crime that I've seen in Atlanta
sw4023.dff	66	B	(Really) (I've) (had) (my)
sw4023.dff	67	A	(And) that was just a guy running out of a store that he just robbed
sw4023.dff	68	B	I've had my car stolen so maybe that counts
sw4023.dff	69	A	(really)
sw4023.dff	71	A	where was that
sw4023.dff	71	A	Was that downtown (or)
sw4023.dff	72	B	no that was up near Cumberland Mall area
sw4023.dff	73	A	(Really)
sw4023.dff	74	B	It's actually Cobb County but it is Atlanta
sw4023.dff	75	A	(Metropolitan)
sw4023.dff	76	B	(and) there's a lot of car thefts in that area
sw4023.dff	77	A	I've known some people that have had their cars stolen
sw4023.dff	77	A	and about half the time the A P D seems to recover them
sw4023.dff	79	A	in various states of disrepair
sw4023.dff	81	A	Up on blocks
sw4023.dff	81	A	My friend had a V W Rabbit and when he got it back his dashboard was sitting in the front seat
sw4023.dff	82	B	it had been wrecked and some superficial type damage but they didn't strip it
sw4023.dff	84	B	so I got it back
sw4023.dff	85	A	you're probably luckier (than)
sw4023.dff	86	B	(than) (most)
sw4023.dff	87	A	so does insurance pay for the body damage or
sw4023.dff	89	A	was that all there was (body)
sw4023.dff	90	B	It was about three grand to put everything together
sw4023.dff	90	B	They cracked the steering column (of) (course) to steal the car
sw4023.dff	92	B	you crack the steering column and (you) (pull) (the) there's a pin in there that you can pull on these G M cars
sw4023.dff	94	B	and you can start it up basically pretty easily
sw4023.dff	95	A	So how do you know this much about stealing cars
sw4023.dff	96	B	(after) (I) (found) (mine) (I) (had) (this)
sw4026.dff	1	A	How's your products been
sw4026.dff	2	B	I really haven't had too many problems
sw4026.dff	2	B	seems to me that everything that I buy goes bad just after the warranty runs out
sw4026.dff	3	A	(I) (hear) (that) (one)
sw4026.dff	3	A	Have you had any lately go out
sw4026.dff	4	B	I've had a dryer an ice maker a microwave all three and they unfortunately I bought them all three at the same time when I bought my new house and I really don't have any recourse so I had to call and have them all repaired and that
sw4026.dff	5	A	(wow)
sw4026.dff	6	B	it was a hassle
sw4026.dff	7	A	So you didn't get anything even all the warranties were out
sw4026.dff	8	B	the warranty on the refrigerator (the) (i-) the refrigerator warranty's still good but the ice maker itself passed its three years and it was three years and two months
sw4026.dff	9	A	You're kidding
sw4026.dff	10	B	(No)
sw4026.dff	11	A	we just moved into a new house too so we had to buy all those too
sw4026.dff	12	B	watch out
sw4026.dff	13	A	the only thing I've had problems with is I buy a lot of wood working equipment through the mail
sw4026.dff	15	A	and I bought this paint stripper where they advertise that it's nontoxic and such and when you get the product it ends up being toxic and all these warnings
sw4026.dff	15	A	So
sw4026.dff	17	A	I didn't return it because it'd probably cost me more than I just ended up using it
sw4026.dff	17	A	But that's about the only thing I've had gone wrong
sw4026.dff	17	A	(But)
sw4026.dff	18	B	I usually have pretty good luck with appliances (but) (I) (just) it was within two days that all three of these stopped working (and) (the)
sw4026.dff	19	A	(That's) (incredible)
sw4026.dff	20	B	the ice maker was had to have a new pump and the microwave had to have some kind of something I can't even pronounce
sw4026.dff	22	B	and they the dryer had to have a new heating element so it was almost three hundred dollars for all three of them
sw4026.dff	23	A	And they all went out at the same time
sw4026.dff	24	B	within two days of each other
sw4026.dff	25	A	(Or) (two) (days)
sw4026.dff	25	A	(Wow)
sw4026.dff	26	B	I was it wasn't a good week
sw4026.dff	26	B	I was pretty mad
sw4026.dff	28	B	plus the place that I'd bought them all had gone out of business so I think even if I had kept the warranty the service agreements were with the companies that manufactured but still they were through that retailer so I don't know if I could have taken it to another retailer or not
sw4026.dff	29	A	(Wow) (it's) (frustrating)
sw4026.dff	30	B	But I didn't have to worry about all that because they weren't under warranty
sw4026.dff	32	B	So
sw4026.dff	32	B	It was a call to the local appliance dealer
sw4026.dff	34	B	who came out and fixed them all but I the only other things that I've ever had trouble with I seem to have a real bad trouble with electric hair dryers blow dryers
sw4026.dff	35	A	they go out a lot
sw4026.dff	36	B	I've had two or three of those go out
sw4026.dff	36	B	One was under warranty and the other two weren't but (I) (just) other than that T V (-s) and things like that I haven't ever had any trouble (with)
sw4026.dff	36	B	I don't think products are getting much better though
sw4026.dff	37	A	I'm in the manufacturing home from work and make automotive air bags (the) (safety) (air) (bags)
sw4026.dff	38	B	(really)
sw4026.dff	40	B	That's interesting
sw4026.dff	41	A	At Morton International (and) (I) (thin-) it's changed a lot with the manufacturing environment
sw4026.dff	41	A	We test everything after each assembly process and so our testing is pretty thorough (but)
sw4026.dff	42	B	do you test each individual one
sw4026.dff	44	B	or do you just test if you've got ten you test one and by the test results of the one you assume that the other nine are okay
sw4026.dff	45	A	(the) (tests) (that) we test every one electrically
sw4026.dff	45	A	(We) (don't) I think they test four or five a day actually exploding the air bags
sw4026.dff	47	A	but we do test during the assembly product after we assemble each part of the inflator or what explodes the bag we check to make sure it's there after we install it (so) each assembly process has an inspection after it's done and then we do electrical tests on them during the process (so)
sw4026.dff	48	B	that's something I've never had to use I've never been involved in an automobile accident (so) luckily that's a product that I haven't had to test
sw4026.dff	50	B	But I think it's a great idea
sw4026.dff	50	B	(I'm) seems like all the good logical ideas take forever to come about but that
sw4026.dff	51	A	they do all the testing that we have to do through the government it's incredible how much testing they have to do
sw4026.dff	52	B	I'm sure they want to be thorough (before) (they)
sw4026.dff	52	B	(But) (even) I don't mind spending the extra money on the car
sw4028.dff	14	B	although it has not disturbed me any
sw4028.dff	15	A	(I) (see)
sw4028.dff	16	B	How about yourself
sw4028.dff	17	A	(I'm) my medical coverage is with an H M O
sw4028.dff	19	A	so in my opinion that's bordering on a health clinic but it seems to be a good way to maintain costs and still provide a good amount of coverage
sw4028.dff	22	B	Our district did that for the ninety-one and the ninety or calendar years and I was in the H M O and (I) (was) because my same doctor agreed to be in it (for) they usually sign a contract or something
sw4028.dff	24	B	and I did have surgery last summer and I paid ten dollars when I went to see him that first day and I've never seen another bill so I
sw4028.dff	26	B	(I) have to say it really works
sw4028.dff	26	B	But again I was fortunate because my doctor agreed to be in it
sw4028.dff	26	B	if you've been going to a doctor for ten years (or) (something) and he elects not to join it can be very stressful (for)
sw4028.dff	27	A	(Yes)
sw4028.dff	28	B	(those) (people)
sw4028.dff	29	A	(That's) I'm fairly young myself (I've) (only) (been) when I first started working (which) three years ago (is) (when) (I) (first) (got) (into) (full) (time) (employment)
sw4028.dff	31	A	(and) (at) (that) (time) I immediately joined the H M O (and) (I) (never) (really) so the only doctor I've (kind) (of) consistently had has been through the H M O and
sw4028.dff	33	A	for me it's worked out real good
sw4028.dff	34	B	but if you have a family and everybody's gone to different doctors it is hard to give up somebody who you feel knows you and your body and just has all the medical history and you feel comfortable with it
sw4028.dff	36	B	I'm sure it would be very stressful and my husband and I have just elected that if that happens I will go and just pay
sw4028.dff	36	B	You can continue to go to your own doctor
sw4028.dff	38	B	but your benefits are not as good
sw4028.dff	39	A	you mentioned you work for a school system
sw4028.dff	39	A	I work for Georgia Tech in the
sw4028.dff	40	B	(all)
sw4028.dff	41	A	research branch and I guess another one that I rank up there high is the kind of job flexibility and time off I enjoy as a benefit
sw4028.dff	42	B	I do too
sw4028.dff	42	B	Are you talking about Spring Break (and)
sw4028.dff	45	A	getting a lot of breaks
sw4028.dff	47	A	between quarters and that and having a lot of vacation
sw4028.dff	48	B	(it) (really) (I) (don't) (think) (most) (of) (our) (teachers) I'm not a teacher I am a secretarial executive assistant but I don't think the teachers could stand the stress all year long
sw4028.dff	50	B	frankly
sw4028.dff	50	B	It is just Texas (has) (really) they want everybody educated no matter what it costs (and) (it) (would) (be) (just) we all look forward to in two weeks we have Spring Break and
sw4028.dff	52	B	I don't know who looks forward to it more the students or the teachers and the staff
sw4028.dff	54	B	What do you do there
sw4028.dff	55	A	I'm not actually on the teaching faculty but we have a large research organization associated with the university and that's who I work with
sw4028.dff	56	B	(Okay)
sw4028.dff	57	A	and we're given a good bit of flexibility in what we do
sw4028.dff	57	A	We can kind of pursue our own interests in terms of the research areas that we study
sw4028.dff	58	B	that's good
sw4028.dff	58	B	I would think that that type of employment one day you might be really tuned in and the next day a little luke warm or something
sw4028.dff	60	B	and it's good that they allow you that
sw4028.dff	62	B	(It) (as) (I) (say) the schools now we do have to work (the) (day) but we do get many days off and we all look forward to it
sw4032.dff	50	B	they seem to think that it won't but you never know
sw4032.dff	51	A	Now if playing basketball are you knees do you have healthy knees
sw4032.dff	52	B	I think my ankles probably are my main weak point
sw4032.dff	53	A	(dear)
sw4032.dff	54	B	But I've kind of taken care of that
sw4032.dff	54	B	I wear high tops and then also a support ankle brace which is very stiff
sw4032.dff	56	B	and wearing that I haven't had any problems in the past year or so
sw4032.dff	57	A	(that's) (good)
sw4032.dff	57	A	you sound just like my husband
sw4032.dff	57	A	He
sw4032.dff	59	A	he injured his ankle about seven months ago playing volleyball and he's just had a heck of a time getting that ankle healthy
sw4032.dff	60	B	(I)
sw4032.dff	61	A	So that's what he does he wears his brace and his high tops (and)
sw4032.dff	62	B	I injured mine so many times that
sw4032.dff	64	B	rehabilitating became quite easy
sw4032.dff	66	B	it would only take three or four days and I could play again on it
sw4032.dff	67	A	(Wow)
sw4032.dff	68	B	(because) after a while you just learn how to rehabilitate yourself
sw4032.dff	70	B	to play that way
sw4032.dff	71	A	(dear)
sw4032.dff	72	B	so how successful is your exercise video
sw4032.dff	73	A	It is amazing how fast you take off the inches
sw4032.dff	75	A	(and) (once) (I) (start) (my) (forty-) I'd like to do the forty-five minutes a day on the bike for a week and then every other day I'd like to incorporate the video and then the bike on the other day
sw4032.dff	77	A	(But) (it) (is) (really) (amazing) (how) (fast) (the) (inches) (come) (off) and the muscle builds
sw4032.dff	79	A	real fast
sw4032.dff	79	A	(you) (can) (start) they recommend doing the video without weights for the first month and then after that you can just start with your five pound dumbbells and then build up to your twenty-five pound dumbbells
sw4032.dff	81	A	and then you're (just) doing repetitious exercises throughout the whole video and it's a hour long video (so)
sw4032.dff	82	B	So it's a good workout
sw4032.dff	83	A	It is I really enjoy that so I'm looking forward to losing this weight and
sw4032.dff	85	A	being firm and healthy
sw4032.dff	86	B	So in the winter (I) (guess) (there's) (a) (lot) (of) it's quite cold (and)
sw4032.dff	87	A	(Yes)
sw4032.dff	88	B	snow
sw4032.dff	89	A	Yes
sw4032.dff	89	A	Now this one has been quite mild
sw4032.dff	89	A	we could have been out walking throughout the whole winter because really we only had about three weeks of snow on the ground
sw4032.dff	89	A	It was quite chilly (but) (not)
sw4033.dff	1	A	how do you get most of your current event information
sw4033.dff	2	B	(see) I'm going to school now and
sw4033.dff	4	B	while I'm working I don't get a chance to read the paper a lot and I don't watch T V as much really either because (my) (free) (time) (is) (kind) (of) (and) I like do other stuff with it
sw4033.dff	6	B	While I'm at work sometimes on the computer network
sw4033.dff	8	B	I read the news sometimes and that's kind of helpful
sw4033.dff	9	A	I would imagine going to college though your professors and different things you keep up on what's going on
sw4033.dff	10	B	(That's) (true) my roommates and stuff
sw4033.dff	12	B	people around me talk about it
sw4033.dff	12	B	And the people I work with are pretty up-to-date on that kind of stuff (so)
sw4033.dff	13	A	I'm a housewife I have three kids and so
sw4033.dff	15	A	I get most of my information probably through just the news at six o'clock
sw4033.dff	17	A	and then talking with people and just hearing what's going on
sw4033.dff	18	B	do you watch like major network news (or) (do) (you) (watch)
sw4033.dff	19	A	Just the regular channel
sw4033.dff	20	B	the MACNEIL LEHRER HOUR
sw4033.dff	21	A	just channel eight
sw4033.dff	22	B	really
sw4033.dff	23	A	That's our channel here that's the eyewitness news
sw4033.dff	26	B	(see) (channel) where I am channel eight's public T V so it's kind of different
sw4033.dff	28	B	(I) (think) (the) I think a lot of the commentators on the major networks it's kind of appropriate now because of the election stuff going on but it seems that they kind of get to throw their opinions into how they report on the news
sw4033.dff	29	A	And I think even in the elections they choose who they're going to follow and who they're not (and) (basically)
sw4033.dff	31	A	if a candidate can get them to follow then the news will kind of publicize his name
sw4033.dff	32	B	(exactly)
sw4033.dff	33	A	I don't think that the way I get the news is the way to get it
sw4033.dff	33	A	I think you get a very lopsided picture of what's going on
sw4033.dff	34	B	because they can only report on they give each candidate perhaps ten second blurbs in which you know to say you just can't get a full picture of
sw4033.dff	36	B	their message unless you have time to sit down and probably read something on it
sw4033.dff	37	A	And the news too it just doesn't cover that many stories it just covers your basic violent crimes
sw4033.dff	39	A	and your catastrophes with weather and stuff but other than that you really don't know what's going on
sw4033.dff	41	A	I will read our current letters that come out on elections and I guess I do read that and I do study who's running in our area and I do study what's going on in the economy
sw4033.dff	41	A	(It) (and) I guess I do read other magazines too to get my information
sw4033.dff	62	B	if they reported every violent crime in Atlanta it would probably take the whole news hour
sw4033.dff	64	B	(But)
sw4033.dff	65	A	I guess we'll get pretty good news coverage in a couple of years when you host the summer olympics
sw4033.dff	66	B	(that's) already they're having in the newspaper they have a section (I) (think) every now and then on the Olympics and they've got a countdown it's like sixteen hundred days or something
sw4033.dff	67	A	I know we're trying to get tickets to it now
sw4033.dff	68	B	(really)
sw4033.dff	70	B	That's going to be crazy that time of year here
sw4033.dff	72	B	But
sw4033.dff	74	B	I can't believe they're stretching out the Olympic news for that much coverage (over) I guess people want to hear about it
sw4033.dff	74	B	Also big in the news now is the Braves because they're in spring training (or) (whatever)
sw4033.dff	76	B	and they did so well last year
sw4033.dff	77	A	that's another thing they spend a long time on sports and I think that's fine I would like to see more time spent on other things
sw4033.dff	79	A	(But)
sw4033.dff	80	B	It seems like (I) (don't) (know) they way they do the newscasts I wish they (kind) (of) separated it if you wanted to watch one thing you could turn to some channel for it but I don't have cable
sw4036.dff	35	A	(and) I did get one summons actually at one point but I declined it which I'm able to do because I'm a student because it was a very bad time
sw4036.dff	36	B	you learn a lot going to the juries like that though
sw4036.dff	37	A	I would like to do at some point but I haven't
sw4036.dff	37	A	one thing that I think you know maybe is a problem (is) (I) (think) that the criminal jury system works pretty well now but I wonder if maybe in some civil cases it doesn't work as well
sw4036.dff	37	A	(Especially) (sort) (of)
sw4036.dff	38	B	I wouldn't think that it does
sw4036.dff	39	A	(wha-)
sw4036.dff	40	B	from what I experienced in them (you) (know) it didn't turn out the way I planned it the way that I would think that it would go
sw4036.dff	41	A	you thought it turned out pretty well
sw4036.dff	42	B	(but) (you) (know) (it) (was) (jury) (was) (unorganized) (and) it just wasn't organized enough for me
sw4036.dff	44	B	I'm not used to it not being organized and I just assumed that it would have been
sw4036.dff	45	A	so it was (just) kind of a zoo and (the) (jurors) (just) (sort) (of) (someone) had to figure out what was going on
sw4036.dff	46	B	(That's) (about) (what) (it) (was)
sw4036.dff	47	A	(That's) (interesting)
sw4036.dff	47	A	did it work out pretty well in the end
sw4036.dff	47	A	did a couple of people (sort) (of) gradually (sort) (of) (assume) (sort) (of) a moderator role in the trial (or)
sw4036.dff	48	B	well they picked one person and then he (finally) moderated everything and made it turn out the way it should have
sw4036.dff	49	A	So it did end up working out pretty well
sw4036.dff	50	B	(it) (ended) (up) (working) (all)
sw4036.dff	51	A	The one thing I sometimes wonder about in civil cases is whether (especially) (sort) (of) (in) (maybe) product liability or medical malpractice where there's (sort) (of) a very technical decision to be made sometimes
sw4036.dff	52	B	(Yes)
sw4036.dff	53	A	it's not (just) a matter of did this guy rip off this guy and it's (just) a matter of interpreting a contract (it's) (sort) (of) (a) (matter) (of) sometimes getting into very technical issues and I wonder if the system works adequately in educating the jurors about whatever issue is under discussion
sw4036.dff	54	B	I don't think that they educate them enough to really know what's going on
sw4036.dff	55	A	in the case you were involved in you said it was (just) (sort) (of) a bank matter of some kind
sw4036.dff	55	A	(So)
sw4036.dff	56	B	the bank was suing them because they went to get the trailer
sw4036.dff	58	B	which was (seemingly) their property
sw4036.dff	60	B	(It) (was) on his property
sw4036.dff	61	A	(so) (the) (deal) (was) (that) he had borrowed money from the bank to buy it and
sw4036.dff	63	A	(he) hadn't made the payments
sw4036.dff	64	B	(So) (they) (came) (to) (get) (it)
sw4036.dff	66	B	And then when they came to get it it was on the landlord's property and he wouldn't let them take it off
sw4036.dff	67	A	(so) (they) (were) (suing) (to) (get) (it) (back)
sw4036.dff	68	B	and it was a double wide so they'd already taken it apart
sw4036.dff	70	B	So they left it there
sw4036.dff	72	B	and then when they came back to get it a couple of days later it had rained and got all in it
sw4036.dff	74	B	So they were suing him for the money and there's no way they could because it was the moving company
sw4037.dff	1	A	Greg I'm not familiar
sw4037.dff	1	A	(I) (think) you guys in Indiana don't you have the death penalty
sw4037.dff	2	B	we do have the death penalty here
sw4037.dff	2	B	It's not exercised very often but we do have it
sw4037.dff	4	B	I believe it I can't even remember the last execution we had here actually
sw4037.dff	6	B	personally I'm in favor of capital punishment
sw4037.dff	6	B	I know there's a lot of problems with it but
sw4037.dff	8	B	seems to me that some crimes are just so heinous that the person just I feel doesn't deserve to live doesn't deserve for the tax payers to spend however many thousands of dollars it costs a year to keep them in prison for life
sw4037.dff	10	B	But I know there's a lot of problems with that they say if you put them on death row and execute them then ten years later you find out that he really didn't do it then that life was wasted but
sw4037.dff	12	B	just seems like in some cases that it's a good policy
sw4037.dff	13	A	I tend to agree with you I've changed my views even within the last few years to be honest
sw4037.dff	13	A	when I was an undergraduate I was a member of Amnesty International
sw4037.dff	15	A	and (of) (course) at that time I thought (you) (know) that the eye for an eye was a stupid argument
sw4037.dff	17	A	(But) (the) (more) now I live in downtown Dallas and (I)
sw4037.dff	19	A	(I've) (seen) I've seen cases (on) in the news and all (where) (where) a (a) person who had murdered a person is back on the street and then commits another murder
sw4037.dff	21	A	I think that maybe a good solution to capital punishment might be reserve it solely for repeat offenders of a crime like murder
sw4037.dff	22	B	that's a thought that I had never really had on that
sw4037.dff	24	B	which seems pretty sensible
sw4037.dff	25	A	it seems sensible and failsafe
sw4037.dff	25	A	(I) (don't) not completely failsafe but if a man's convicted of two murders there's a pretty good chance that something's wrong
sw4037.dff	27	A	(I) (also) to tell you how liberal I have turned toward this or whatever side that is
sw4037.dff	29	A	I've (kind) (of) chosen I believe it that big time drug importers like Noriega for example
sw4037.dff	31	A	that these people need to be eliminated
sw4037.dff	33	A	from society and I think the death penalty is the best choice for those people because really any kind of jail sentence for them is just another chance to create another power structure
sw4037.dff	34	B	you're there
sw4037.dff	34	B	basically my views I guess they tend to be more economically oriented
sw4037.dff	36	B	in that (you) (know) they come out with these figures that it costs fifty thousand taxpayer dollars a year to keep someone alive in jail
sw4037.dff	38	B	when they're going to be there for life they're never going to be rehabilitated
sw4037.dff	40	B	I don't believe that the prison system that we have today does much towards rehabilitation to begin with
sw4037.dff	42	B	so to me I'm paying taxes twenty percent of my check or whatever
sw4037.dff	44	B	to keep somebody alive who in my mind shouldn't be there in the first place and is never going to be a valuable or worthwhile part of society so I'm all in favor of it
sw4037.dff	45	A	(do) (you) are there cases where you think that the capital punishment shouldn't be sentenced
sw4037.dff	46	B	I really don't know on that question
sw4037.dff	46	B	It just seems like for instance the Jeffrey Dahlmer case
sw4037.dff	46	B	I don't really think that this person is going to ever be a worthwhile part of society
sw4037.dff	46	B	I hope the guy never gets back out on the streets
sw4037.dff	48	B	and in that case Wisconsin doesn't have a death penalty so he's going to be sentenced to life imprisonment
sw4037.dff	50	B	and I think that he should not be allowed to live but then you're kind of playing God
sw4037.dff	51	A	(That's) (true)
sw4037.dff	52	B	which is never a good thing to do
sw4037.dff	54	B	But cases where I think the death penalty should be withheld not really that I can think of
sw4037.dff	54	B	I would be in favor of the death penalty in things like murders and like you said repeat murders or
sw4037.dff	56	B	serial killers
sw4037.dff	58	B	I don't really agree with the death penalty for people like Noriega and such as that
sw4037.dff	58	B	(I) (think) (that) (they're) (operating) (on) (a) (more) I know that they're causing massive problems in society up here but I don't really think that it's in our power to take these people from a sovereign state and say you don't deserve to live (because)
sw4037.dff	60	B	they're feeding our consumer needs
sw4037.dff	61	A	(Sure) I understand your point
sw4037.dff	61	A	of course with Dahlmer now you realize that I think it's Ohio gets to try him next and
sw4037.dff	63	A	they do have the death penalty
sw4037.dff	65	A	so that was a curious case
sw4037.dff	65	A	(I)
sw4037.dff	66	B	that is very curious
sw4037.dff	67	A	something is sort of nightmarish
sw4037.dff	69	A	to say the least
sw4037.dff	70	B	(that's)
sw4037.dff	71	A	here in Texas (we) I think even last week they (they) use their capital punishment by lethal injection
sw4038.dff	16	B	so it was a combination of criminal and civil and (they) (had) most of the time we spent sitting around in the jury room (and) getting to know the other potential jurors
sw4038.dff	18	B	and then it was always exciting when we got called to go because then we thought we might be able to do something else besides just sit in the jury room
sw4038.dff	19	A	did the judge hand down sentences or did you folks do that
sw4038.dff	20	B	the judge did
sw4038.dff	20	B	I had a hard time getting seated on a jury
sw4038.dff	20	B	(I) (kept) (getting) I'd be questioned for empaneling the jury and
sw4038.dff	22	B	they kept dismissing me
sw4038.dff	24	B	(Course) they don't have to give a reason but it's just
sw4038.dff	25	A	(No)
sw4038.dff	26	B	whether the prosecutor or the defense attorney feels like they want to get the best mix for their case so
sw4038.dff	27	A	(That)
sw4038.dff	28	B	they ask all kinds of wild questions
sw4038.dff	29	A	that's a science in itself
sw4038.dff	30	B	I kept getting called up for drunk driving questions and I think part of it was they didn't like the fact that I don't drink any more
sw4038.dff	31	A	(I) (see)
sw4038.dff	33	A	Because you'd probably be too puritanical (and)
sw4038.dff	34	B	(that) (was)
sw4038.dff	35	A	()
sw4038.dff	36	B	probably (it) although in my case I might have been more sympathetic with the person who got caught (I) (don't) (know)
sw4038.dff	39	A	were the sentences that the judge handed out what you thought to be fair or (would) if you were deciding do you think that they would have been different
sw4038.dff	40	B	I was never there for any sentencing
sw4038.dff	40	B	I finally got empaneled on one case on my next to the last day and we got into the jury room to decide the case and there was one guy on the jury who announced to everybody that he didn't need to deliberate because he'd already decided that the guy was not guilty and he would never vote for guilty
sw4038.dff	42	B	So they appointed me jury foreman and I didn't think that going in without deliberating allowed us to reach a verdict so I told the judge that we were unable to reach a verdict because we couldn't get one member of the jury to deliberate
sw4038.dff	44	B	So the whole thing had to be tried over again
sw4038.dff	45	A	(Wow) I bet that made him happy
sw4038.dff	46	B	it was funny
sw4038.dff	46	B	(The) (I) (don't) (know) I didn't like not being able to deliberate
sw4038.dff	48	B	I wanted to vote guilty for the guy and the other people were kind of mixed
sw4038.dff	50	B	the guy had to go through the whole thing all over again
sw4038.dff	50	B	Cost him a lot of money I'm sure
sw4038.dff	51	A	(how) (many) (members) (were) (on) (the) (jury)
sw4038.dff	51	A	Was it a six or twelve member jury
sw4038.dff	52	B	it must have been six
sw4038.dff	55	A	That's kind of curious to me
sw4038.dff	55	A	I didn't realize until the Wayne Kennedy Smith trial a few months ago that they had six member juries
sw4038.dff	55	A	I thought that (you) (know) it was always twelve men tried and true so to speak
sw4038.dff	57	A	But apparently for some crimes it's permissible to have six people sit in judgment
sw4038.dff	59	A	I know (on) (a) getting to this unanimous thing whether a jury should be unanimous or not in a court martial case it doesn't require the jury to be unanimous
sw4038.dff	59	A	It's a simple majority rules
sw4038.dff	60	B	(Well) (let's)
sw4038.dff	62	B	(see) is it on capital crimes that they have to be unanimous (and)
sw4038.dff	63	A	Probably on capital (I) (don't) (know) (we) the two that I were on had to do with drugs
sw4038.dff	65	A	and we were unanimous is acquitting the person even though we in our gut felt that the individuals were both guilty just because of various things the government really failed to prove its case and being fair to the person if the government doesn't prove its case no matter how you feel you have to go by what's offered as proof (and) (we) (had) (to) (acquit) (him) (in) (both) (cases)
sw4038.dff	66	B	it was too circumstantial
sw4038.dff	67	A	(it) (was) in some of the critical things like special investigations at one time in one of the cases had videotaped this person but something happened to the camera and the tape and
sw4038.dff	69	A	all they could do was testify
sw4048.dff	14	A	That's interesting
sw4048.dff	15	B	(it's) (a)
sw4048.dff	16	A	What (type) (of) field of work are you in
sw4048.dff	17	B	I'm in the oil business
sw4048.dff	18	A	(in) (the) (oil) (business)
sw4048.dff	20	A	(Okay) and you work in the office (around)
sw4048.dff	21	B	I work in the office so it's pretty safe environment
sw4048.dff	24	A	I work in the automotive air bag industry where we make the safety bags
sw4048.dff	26	A	for the cars and we work around a lot of explosives
sw4048.dff	27	B	that sounds like (kind) (of) an important job to be straight on
sw4048.dff	28	A	(so) (that's) I'm all for it because (well) the type of environment I work in they're working with explosives and (so) they could blow up (the) (whole) they have safety features with each of the explosives (they) (use) but still it can be dangerous
sw4048.dff	29	B	(I) (agree)
sw4048.dff	29	B	I think that under certain circumstances especially when you're working in high risk industries where you can really hurt other people (that) you need to have that kind of stuff
sw4048.dff	31	B	(if) (it's) as long as it's not abused (random) as long as it's random and the individual's rights are protected I don't have that big a problem with it
sw4048.dff	32	A	do they fire them (or) (do) (they)
sw4048.dff	33	B	(this) (is) (it) this is where I start having (my) problems with my company
sw4048.dff	33	B	I work for a private company and
sw4048.dff	35	B	(and) the policy is something like (see) (if) (I) (can) (re-) (state) (this) (correctly) (now)
sw4048.dff	35	B	If you turn yourself in as having a drug related problem (then) you're eligible for company counseling
sw4048.dff	37	B	But (if) (they) (catch) (you) if you test positive for a controlled substance then you get fired
sw4048.dff	38	A	(wow)
sw4048.dff	39	B	So (you) (know) it's (sort) (of) one of these (little) catch twenty-twos
sw4048.dff	40	A	(that's)
sw4048.dff	40	A	I think our policy is that (all) it's probably the same thing
sw4048.dff	40	A	(I'm) (not) (really) (sure) (what) (the)
sw4048.dff	41	B	(really) it's one of those things that you read once and then if you're not worried about it you just forget about it
sw4048.dff	42	A	(That's) But I know they do have counseling and that they do give you a second chance but I'm not sure if
sw4048.dff	44	A	if it's if you get caught or if you turn yourself in
sw4048.dff	45	B	our company's a little tougher on the second chance
sw4048.dff	45	B	if they're going to give you the opportunity to turn yourself in then they ought to go out of the way I think a little bit more to help get you rehabilitated you know to get back at your job
sw4048.dff	47	B	But when you're a private company the rules don't always apply
sw4048.dff	48	A	(do) (you) (think) (it) (limits)
sw4048.dff	49	B	it's hard for me to evaluate it because everybody I work around is in an office environment and (it's) (not) I guess I haven't run into anybody that's been a problem
sw4048.dff	51	B	so (you) (know) I guess it works (much) (well) (shoot) like any lottery everybody's got an equal chance to get picked
sw4048.dff	53	B	I'd rather have that than say this week the A -s and B -s are going to be in and next week
sw4048.dff	55	B	C -s and D -s are going to come in
sw4048.dff	56	A	You could time it (just)
sw4048.dff	58	A	I know one employee (I) (know) when I was working with he had alcohol on his breath and I'm not sure if our policy covers that or not
sw4048.dff	58	A	That'd be just as dangerous
sw4048.dff	59	B	especially around equipment machinery and stuff
sw4048.dff	60	A	(That's) (true)
sw4048.dff	61	B	I've gone out and had a beer at lunch time but not to excess in any case
sw4048.dff	62	A	Do they give any limits on alcohol (or) (is) (it)
sw4048.dff	63	B	I don't remember to tell you the truth
sw4048.dff	63	B	I don't think they do
sw4048.dff	63	B	(they) (must) (gee) (whiz)
sw4048.dff	63	B	That just shows you how much I've been paying attention because I really don't know
sw4048.dff	65	B	I'll have to go into work tomorrow and ask
sw4048.dff	67	B	you can take some of that testing a little bit too far
sw4048.dff	67	B	there was a company in Houston they did an unannounced drug sweep of their company
sw4048.dff	69	B	(it) (was) (an) (unannounced) (sweep) of (it) (was) not only drugs
sw4049.dff	1	B	I myself am not in favor of drug testing in the work place except in this very specific examples such as transportation workers as in air traffic controllers bus drivers (and) (that) (kind) (of) (thing)
sw4049.dff	3	B	I don't really think that it's too many I think it's a severe invasion of somebody's privacy to say we're going to look at your urine and then decide whether you're worthy of working for us
sw4049.dff	3	B	I really don't see that that's a very valid thing for a company to say and personally (I) don't think I would work for somebody if they were going to reject me on the basis of what's inside my body
sw4049.dff	4	A	(I) (guess) (I) (basically) (agree) (that) do you think it's okay for a company to reject somebody knowing that they'll take drugs
sw4049.dff	4	A	suppose they found out some other way
sw4049.dff	5	B	(I) (think) the problem here is that a drug test does not necessarily imply that someone is taking drugs or not taking drugs
sw4049.dff	7	B	There's too many cases where (it) (can) there can be false positive results (and) (that) (sort) (of) (thing)
sw4049.dff	7	B	I don't think there's any definitive okay this person is taking drugs so we don't want him here
sw4049.dff	9	B	(like) (I) (said) some industries (though) I think it'd be very necessary I wouldn't want any air traffic controllers high or anything like that when I'm flying in an airplane
sw4049.dff	11	B	But I find it to be pretty offensive that it's such a big deal
sw4049.dff	11	B	(if) (your) (employer's) (not) (going) (to) (trust) (you) (or) (it) I think it's a (whole) trust issue
sw4049.dff	11	B	(I) (just) (can't) (see) (it)
sw4049.dff	12	A	But have you ever been in a situation where you were drug tested (or)
sw4049.dff	29	B	(or) (something) (pretty) (basic) (like) (that) (just) (to) (the) (fact) (that) I don't know that it is a company's business to regulate what it's employees are doing when they're not at work
sw4049.dff	29	B	I mean during the eight hours (during) (the) (day) when they're supposed to be there I think they have every to say this is these behaviors are acceptable and these are not but when it enters into what they're doing when they're not at work I find that to be fairly offensive also
sw4049.dff	30	A	(like) (you) (say) if it's not a critical kind of job where someone could get hurt then really I mean the employer ought to be judging you on how well you do your work
sw4049.dff	32	A	rather than on these other factors
sw4049.dff	34	A	And if you are doing drugs and it's causing a problem then they'll notice it for other reasons
sw4049.dff	35	B	(That's) (exactly)
sw4049.dff	37	B	(And) (also) (I) (just) (think) (it) (gets) (a) (lot) I'm a big supporter of personal freedoms and personal privacies and I think that it just moves down along a line that I really would find bad if most people went down that line into regulating employees' lives outside of work there's already talk of people we're not going to hire you if you smoke
sw4049.dff	39	B	I can see how they can say in the work place you don't want them to smoke but when somebody leaves work I don't think that it's the employer's to regulate their life style at all
sw4049.dff	40	A	do you think it's should be illegal for an employer to do this (or)
sw4049.dff	41	B	I really think it should be except as I've mentioned twice now in the specified industries
sw4049.dff	43	B	or jobs because there are certain things where it's just vital that a person is clear minded at all times
sw4049.dff	43	B	And other than that I do not think it should be allowable
sw4049.dff	43	B	I think it should be illegal for them to want to do that
sw4049.dff	43	B	it's kind of the big brother syndrome (I) (just) anything like that just kind of scares me
sw4049.dff	44	A	I tend to view it even though I don't think I'd work for a company that did that I (sort) (of) want to defend an employer's rights in addition to an individual's rights but an employer really I think has the to hire someone on any basis they want to
sw4049.dff	46	A	and if they say they don't want smokers I (sort) (of) feel like an employer should have the to decide whether they want to allow that
sw4049.dff	48	A	(and) (I) (don't) (really)
sw4050.dff	36	A	and then did you have a main meal or did everyone just bring (it) (was) (just) pot luck
sw4050.dff	37	B	It was kind of pot luck
sw4050.dff	39	B	everybody brought their specialties I guess you would say
sw4050.dff	40	A	show off a little bit
sw4050.dff	41	B	And of course my grandmother's food was as always gone first
sw4050.dff	43	B	because she's such a great cook
sw4050.dff	44	A	Now how old is she
sw4050.dff	45	B	she's eighty-six
sw4050.dff	46	A	(goodness)
sw4050.dff	46	A	(is) (she) (pretty)
sw4050.dff	47	B	Now (she) (does) she looks probably like she's in her early sixties
sw4050.dff	48	A	(wow)
sw4050.dff	49	B	and if she didn't have arthritis she'd get around better
sw4050.dff	51	B	than me as a matter of fact
sw4050.dff	52	A	that's neat that she's in good health and at that age
sw4050.dff	53	B	My nickname for her is Honey Woman
sw4050.dff	53	B	That's what I call her
sw4050.dff	54	A	(Really)
sw4050.dff	54	A	(that) (sounds) (fun)
sw4050.dff	54	A	I had a real challenge of planning a family reunion a few years ago and (there) (were) we sent out five hundred announcements because our family is quite large like your family there
sw4050.dff	54	A	And so that was a real challenge and I was president of our family reunion for two years and I (wasn't) (very) (at) (that) (duty) (for) (two) (years) (in) (a) (row) (but) (I) found that advance planning was the key to success
sw4050.dff	55	B	also one thing that's helpful and I don't know if your family's spread out (or) (whatever)
sw4050.dff	57	B	but all my family lives in the same county (so)
sw4050.dff	58	A	(that's) (wonderful) (though)
sw4050.dff	59	B	But it's (just) (kind) (of) like get on the telephone and
sw4050.dff	61	B	it's so and such days from such and such date
sw4050.dff	63	B	and everybody just shows up
sw4050.dff	64	A	that is helpful
sw4050.dff	64	A	our family ranges from (goodness) Australia I have a brother lives in Australia to Boise Idaho and all kinds of places
sw4050.dff	65	B	I would say you're spread out then
sw4050.dff	66	A	(We) (are)
sw4050.dff	67	B	my immediate family my parents and my brothers and sisters (I) (guess) we're the ones that have the gypsy blood (or) (whatever) because my dad was in the Army and we're
sw4050.dff	69	B	(we're) pretty strung out all over
sw4050.dff	69	B	But since they've moved back to Carolina's we still are the only ones do not live in
sw4050.dff	70	A	(In)
sw4050.dff	71	B	(in) Yantsen County
sw4050.dff	73	B	I live in Raleigh and then my parents live in Greenville and I have one brother and his wife
sw4050.dff	75	B	live in Greenville and another brother that lives outside of Fayetteville
sw4050.dff	75	B	So we're spread out but
sw4050.dff	76	A	(Boy)
sw4050.dff	77	B	everybody else is centralized in my home town Waynesboro (so)
sw4050.dff	78	A	(my) (gosh)
sw4050.dff	79	B	Nobody moves away except us
sw4050.dff	80	A	(They) (must) (really) (like) (it) (there)
sw4050.dff	81	B	I got out as soon as I graduated
sw4050.dff	83	B	(Just) (like) this town is too small for me Good-bye
sw4050.dff	84	A	(you're) (ready) (to) (move) (on) (to) (bi-)
sw4051.dff	6	B	(So)
sw4051.dff	7	A	Have they stopped that practice now
sw4051.dff	8	B	(course) there's a tremendous number of (excuse) (me) refrigerators and freezers both commercial and residential utilizing freon twelve and of course the new cars (I) (guess) starting with nineteen ninety-three will not have freon twelve in their systems
sw4051.dff	8	B	But there's the ton of after market machines and et cetera et (cetera)
sw4051.dff	10	B	And that's got me very highly concerned that that's going to be quite a while before we can
sw4051.dff	12	B	undo this
sw4051.dff	12	B	Now that could spawn several good industries and help
sw4051.dff	14	B	pull us out of this recession but you got to have people that can (you) (know) earn a salary to pay for this conversion
sw4051.dff	14	B	so I see us in somewhat of a catch twenty-two unless the banks or industry and the government go together and come up with a way to have us as a part of the unemployed society be able to be gainfully employed again converting all this freon twelve stuff into the new nonpolluting compound
sw4051.dff	16	B	Because (as) (I) (say) (there's) (a) (tremen-) how many families own a refrigerator and then do (you) (know) that number how many a freezer separate from
sw4051.dff	18	B	and how many people especially here in Texas own cars and trucks with air conditioning
sw4051.dff	20	B	there are people that have a thriving business that do nothing but heating and air conditioning on automobiles and trucks and the only reason I didn't get into that more when I had my little business was because most of your air conditioning on vehicles tend to be greasy and dirty to the N-th degree
sw4051.dff	22	B	and
sw4051.dff	24	B	so that's why I stayed more towards and that's a polluting type deal too is the excessive petroleum products in your engine bay (and) (so) (forth) and the dirt and grit and those two mixed together with water really make a mess
sw4055.dff	1	A	(Okay) (Bill)
sw4055.dff	2	B	(Yes)
sw4055.dff	3	A	(Okay) Bill have you done much camping
sw4055.dff	4	B	yes
sw4055.dff	4	B	I'm a scoutmaster in Boy Scouts
sw4055.dff	6	B	And I camp at least one weekend and during the summer we camp two or three weeks a year
sw4055.dff	7	A	(that) (sounds) (good)
sw4055.dff	8	B	I'd say I camp quite a bit
sw4055.dff	9	A	(you) (do)
sw4055.dff	9	A	(do) (you) (have) (a) (lot) (mountains) you don't have mountains in Texas do you
sw4055.dff	9	A	Where do you find places to camp
sw4055.dff	10	B	we do a lot of canoeing when we go camping
sw4055.dff	12	B	and we also carry all our equipment with us
sw4055.dff	14	B	and so we canoe down the river and then
sw4055.dff	16	B	sleep on the river on one of the sand bars and then
sw4055.dff	18	B	get up the next morning cook our breakfast and go down the river again
sw4055.dff	19	A	(my) (word)
sw4055.dff	19	A	that sounds adventuresome
sw4055.dff	20	B	How about yourself
sw4055.dff	21	A	I've done (I) (would) (say) quite a bit of camping mostly with my husband and I
sw4055.dff	21	A	we have five children and so we have found that camping with the little ones isn't as enjoyable as just when we go ourselves
sw4055.dff	21	A	So we've tried to get out once a year and go on a anniversary camp out and we have gone up into the mountains and not necessarily roughed it but we have just found it just real enjoyable to be alone up in the mountains
sw4055.dff	22	B	(that's) (good)
sw4055.dff	23	A	And then our boys are old enough now they're twelve and eleven (and) (so) they're involved in the scouting (and) (they) (do) (a) (lot) (of) (camping) (with) (the) (scouts)
sw4055.dff	25	A	and last time our one twelve year old went to the scout camp for a week (and) so this year they'll both be going and (so) that's been real enjoyable for them
sw4055.dff	26	B	(Great)
sw4055.dff	28	B	what kind of camping do they like best
sw4055.dff	28	B	Do they like it where they have tents and do they cook on stoves
sw4055.dff	29	A	(yes) (they've) (no) (actually) I remember they have taken the heavy cast iron dutch ovens and done their cooking there over the fire and I don't think they've taken the stoves
sw4055.dff	29	A	last year they camped in tents and this year I believe they will be in tents also
sw4055.dff	30	B	Course I imagine it gets cold in parts of Utah
sw4055.dff	32	B	It doesn't get very cold in Texas
sw4055.dff	34	B	so lots of times we don't even take tents
sw4055.dff	35	A	(is) (that)
sw4055.dff	36	B	We just use trail tarps
sw4055.dff	37	A	and what does that consist of
sw4055.dff	38	B	it's just a piece of material that has a lot of places where you can tie off to it
sw4055.dff	40	B	and make it into a tent
sw4055.dff	42	B	(like) (a) they're very light weight and we use them when we go backpacking
sw4055.dff	42	B	So we go backpacking fifteen or twenty miles then they're not very heavy
sw4055.dff	44	B	so you carry them with you and
sw4055.dff	46	B	they'll keep you dry (or) (whatever)
sw4055.dff	47	A	(Yes) when we go camping here we have to take our big huge heavy sleeping bags and lots of tents and I like to sleep on the air matresses
sw4055.dff	47	A	(I'm) (not) my bones are getting so old so I like to sleep on the matresses
sw4055.dff	49	A	so have you had any encounters with wild animals or anything like that
sw4055.dff	50	B	yes in fact last month we went camping we saw a lot of deer
sw4055.dff	52	B	in the morning and the afternoon
sw4055.dff	53	A	(My) (word)
sw4055.dff	54	B	just deer everywhere
sw4055.dff	55	A	(Gee)
sw4055.dff	56	B	but even though it wasn't hunting season and we were with Boy Scouts so
sw4055.dff	58	B	of course we don't want to go hunting
sw4055.dff	60	B	But we got to see a lot of deer
sw4055.dff	62	B	out and about and (there's) (of) (course) we see smaller animals all the time and one thing that is a big concern in the evening at night is make sure that all the food's put away and so forth
sw4055.dff	64	B	because we have armadillos
sw4055.dff	64	B	Do you know what
sw4055.dff	66	B	armadillo is
sw4055.dff	67	A	they're covered with a heavy armor
sw4055.dff	69	A	type stuff
sw4055.dff	70	B	And possums and raccoons
sw4055.dff	71	A	(My) (word)
sw4055.dff	72	B	And we have those creatures down here that they like to go hunting for a midnight snack
sw4055.dff	74	B	And so that can be a problem if you don't put all your equipment away
sw4055.dff	75	A	But they won't necessarily attack a human or bite you or anything
sw4055.dff	76	B	They will if you attack them
sw4055.dff	78	B	But most time they run away from you
sw4055.dff	80	B	if they see you're up
sw4055.dff	82	B	but they don't have any problem walking by you if you're asleep
sw4055.dff	83	A	(my) (word)
sw4055.dff	85	A	that sounds a little less fierce than bears
sw4055.dff	85	A	(we) (want) (to)
sw4056.dff	1	A	(Okay) (should) (begin)
sw4056.dff	2	B	(Okay)
sw4056.dff	2	B	(All)
sw4056.dff	3	A	I can begin this (basically) I work for Honeywell in Minneapolis
sw4056.dff	5	A	and the benefit program we have (here) is really quite good
sw4056.dff	5	A	I'm pretty pleased with it
sw4056.dff	5	A	They cover just about everything vision dental medical
sw4056.dff	7	A	you name it and for me this is the first job I've had where they've covered that much so I'm pretty satisfied myself
sw4056.dff	9	A	what's your situation
sw4056.dff	10	B	I work for the University of New Hampshire and
sw4056.dff	12	B	our benefits package isn't quite as good in some ways
sw4056.dff	12	B	overall I'm satisfied with it
sw4056.dff	12	B	We don't have the vision care we do have the health care and (the) (or) (the) dental
sw4056.dff	15	A	Are you a professor there
sw4056.dff	16	B	No I'm on the professional administrative and technical staff and effectively I run the telephone switch at the University of New Hampshire
sw4056.dff	17	A	(I) (see) (okay)
sw4056.dff	18	B	(the) (benefits) probably the main thing I like (about) (the) (benefits) is the very generous vacation (time) and sick time
sw4056.dff	19	A	(no) (doubt)
sw4056.dff	20	B	We get fifteen days a year sick time and from the day one (when) (you) (start) (work) you get twenty-four days a year time off
sw4056.dff	21	A	(that's) (good)
sw4056.dff	23	A	that's one of the things (I) (guess) I would change about Honeywell (is) I used to work with the Army Research Institute and being a government organization you got quite a few holidays off
sw4056.dff	25	A	But here you don't get that
sw4056.dff	25	A	You maybe get two or three a year
sw4056.dff	27	A	(So) (it's) (really) unless you have some vacation time or (some) sick leave (or) (whatever) you (kind) (of) have to finagle your way around to get that time
sw4056.dff	29	A	(So) that's kind of a drawback (I) (think)
sw4056.dff	29	A	(But) (I) (don't) (know)
sw4056.dff	29	A	What do you consider most important (you) (think) in terms of the different benefits
sw4056.dff	30	B	(I) (think) the health care of course is an important and has to be the single most important benefit
sw4056.dff	32	B	and the rates that we keep paying seem to keep increasing
sw4056.dff	34	B	I'm a little disturbed about that but I think that's a national trend and I don't know what the solution is to it
sw4056.dff	34	B	It's bigger than just the benefits part
sw4056.dff	35	A	I don't know if you saw on TWENTY TWENTY the other night they basically reviewed Oregon's plan
sw4056.dff	37	A	The Oregon Plan
sw4056.dff	39	A	toward nationalizing health care (and) (that) (kind) (of) (thing)
sw4056.dff	39	A	It's kind of an interesting plan
sw4056.dff	39	A	It's (kind) (of) cold though
sw4056.dff	39	A	They've essentially made up a list of all the different medical maladies that you can have
sw4056.dff	41	A	and then basically made a cutoff about six hundred and eighty-seven and below will not be covered by subsidized health care and the ones above would
sw4056.dff	54	B	But it pays a substantial amount
sw4056.dff	54	B	the examinations and checkups or every six months are free
sw4056.dff	55	A	(Great)
sw4056.dff	56	B	and it covers the bulk of the dental expenses
sw4056.dff	57	A	let me interrupt is that the same for both professors and also staff and administration is that generally across the board do you think (or)
sw4056.dff	58	B	yes it is
sw4056.dff	58	B	The benefits plan is different for what we call operating staff which are considered to be clerical personnel accountants things like that
sw4056.dff	60	B	as opposed to what they call the P A T staff which I belong to
sw4056.dff	62	B	but (the) (main) I think the health and all that and the dental is the same for everybody and the retirement plan
sw4056.dff	62	B	But
sw4056.dff	64	B	the main difference is in the way sick time is accrued and vacation time is accrued
sw4056.dff	65	A	(okay)
sw4056.dff	66	B	for the operating staff it's (it's) based on how long they've worked there
sw4056.dff	68	B	That determines how much vacation time they get
sw4056.dff	69	A	I'm kind of interested because actually that's the route I'd like to take when I finally get my degree
sw4056.dff	71	A	is to teach in a university
sw4056.dff	73	A	I'm a doctoral student in Florida now
sw4056.dff	75	A	(but) (that's) (interesting)
sw4056.dff	75	A	That's one of the things I'd like to think about is (in) what kind of benefits they would cover and things like that
sw4056.dff	76	B	College programs belong to this T I A A C R E F retirement fund
sw4056.dff	77	A	(is) (that)
sw4056.dff	78	B	(and) (in) (the) (case) (of) (the) (University) (of) (New) (Hampshire)
sw4060.dff	1	A	Okay Karen
sw4060.dff	1	A	you're first
sw4060.dff	2	B	Okay
sw4060.dff	2	B	I was just going to say I think one of the biggest thing for me is room for advancement
sw4060.dff	2	B	not to get like in a dead end job
sw4060.dff	4	B	And plus for me it's medical and benefits and dental
sw4060.dff	5	A	(Okay)
sw4060.dff	6	B	They're also important
sw4060.dff	7	A	I guess one of the differences I see is working for a university there is room for advancement but not so much so in quite a highly unionized environment
sw4060.dff	9	A	and then also in the administrative association so there is a progressive path but not being in say the commercial sector the motivation isn't there for a lot of people
sw4060.dff	11	A	really
sw4060.dff	12	B	Are they pretty much train for a specific job and that what I hired for and then just very little variation from that
sw4060.dff	13	A	(somewhat) (that) but then also there just isn't the ability to in one sense have a broader scope for rewarding people for their performances
sw4060.dff	15	A	so that's in our situation where we are dealing with an institution it's a little more difficult to recognize an individual's performance
sw4060.dff	17	A	and I suppose that's maybe a disadvantage of being in a larger institution perhaps somewhat even with the business But I agree the medical benefits and those kinds of things are one of the big pluses of working for a large organization and also the security aspect for long term employment
sw4060.dff	18	B	that's interesting though
sw4060.dff	18	B	Because I don't know if that's necessarily the case anymore
sw4060.dff	18	B	(I) (use) (to) (think) (that) (after) (you) (work) you mean job security
sw4060.dff	19	A	(Job) (security) (yes)
sw4060.dff	20	B	that use to be I think a couple of years ago but I don't know if it is so much anymore
sw4060.dff	20	B	In fact we just had a lay off in what November I guess
sw4060.dff	22	B	But (it) (wasn't) (necessarily) some people had been there a long time
sw4060.dff	23	A	we are seeing that here as well
sw4060.dff	23	A	in some of the large oil companies
sw4060.dff	23	A	There has been massive lay offs
sw4060.dff	25	A	I think it's probably a major distinction between institutions and the corporate world
sw4060.dff	27	A	in institutions are slower to react both on the growth side and then also on the reduction side where the businesses we need to cut back that's what we do
sw4060.dff	28	B	(No) (doubt)
sw4060.dff	29	A	But
sw4060.dff	31	A	(and) institutionally like here at the university if there is a cut back it's not where it's needed it's where it's most expedient (which)
sw4060.dff	32	B	(Expedient) (that's) (exactly) (it)
sw4060.dff	32	B	where it cuts back the most
sw4060.dff	33	A	in one sense for us it's where it makes the least noise which means it's
sw4060.dff	35	A	often the lowest support type roles
sw4060.dff	37	A	(we)
sw4060.dff	38	B	(I) (think) that's one of the things too
sw4060.dff	38	B	You get too many management people
sw4060.dff	39	A	(It's) (very) (easy)
sw4060.dff	40	B	and it's very easy for them to say this is the best way when they really aren't aware of what (all) it took to get the work done
sw4060.dff	42	B	And then they wonder why it doesn't get done in the same amount of time
sw4060.dff	42	B	those people aren't there anymore
sw4060.dff	43	A	Because it's support people that are providing
sw4060.dff	45	A	the speed for it
sw4060.dff	48	B	but what else do you think is important
sw4060.dff	49	A	(the) that's maybe the majority of the importance (I) (guess)
sw4060.dff	49	A	because my perspective is from an institution there is not much incentive for innovativeness
sw4060.dff	51	A	because the limitation for reward is very severe
sw4060.dff	53	A	but if you're in the corporate world I think there is considerable motivation for (I) (guess) innovation although (you) (know) the more complex your structure the less difficult it is to (kind) (of) carry some things through
sw4060.dff	55	A	but (I) (think) it's a long term type of process where in a small organization things can happen much more quickly and so you can see the reward of the efforts
sw4060.dff	56	B	(I) (think) (probably) (in) (a) (small) (I) (was) (going) (to) (say) it's more personal for one thing
sw4060.dff	56	B	You probably have a better team cooperation or team playing atmosphere
sw4060.dff	58	B	Probably where as in a bigger corporation (I) (think) you're just a number
sw4060.dff	59	A	You end up being your own person
sw4060.dff	61	A	and if you do your job fine and if somebody else is messing it up then that's their problem (and)
sw4060.dff	63	A	(you) (really)
sw4060.dff	64	B	whereas in a smaller (I) (think) you would be more willing to either help that person or help it get accomplished
sw4060.dff	65	A	It becomes the organization instead of person being a part of the individual themselves
sw4064.dff	1	A	how do you feel about trial by jury
sw4064.dff	2	B	I feel very uncomfortable with trials by juries recently
sw4064.dff	3	A	In what way
sw4064.dff	4	B	In that it seems to me that they are swayed more by emotion than by evidence that's presented
sw4064.dff	4	B	I have very little regard for the law
sw4064.dff	6	B	presently practiced
sw4064.dff	7	A	(do) (you) (feel) (they) (are) (swayed) (more) (toward) are you talking about with criminal or civil suits
sw4064.dff	8	B	I was thinking primarily criminal cases
sw4064.dff	9	A	do you think that the stereotypical bleeding heart juries
sw4064.dff	10	B	Yes
sw4064.dff	11	A	where they feel sorry
sw4064.dff	12	B	That's a concern of mine
sw4064.dff	12	B	I would feel more comfortable in many cases I think with judges
sw4064.dff	12	B	doing the sentencing
sw4064.dff	13	A	(the) (only) (thing) (that) (really) (bothers) (me) (about) (that) (is) (I) (think) (that) (a) (judge) (can) (be) I like the idea of juries of your peers
sw4064.dff	15	A	in that you get personally more than one person making a decision
sw4064.dff	15	A	And second of all you get a wide variety of background (so) (that)
sw4064.dff	16	B	my question I guess are they really your peers
sw4064.dff	17	A	I'd
sw4064.dff	19	A	agree with that
sw4064.dff	19	A	That's definitely a problem
sw4064.dff	20	B	too often I think they are not
sw4064.dff	22	B	and when you are selecting a jury and you are doing it partially if not entirely on the basis of which color representation you have
sw4064.dff	24	B	is a matter of concern to me too
sw4064.dff	24	B	I think that in such cases they are not really looking for unbiased people but rather for biased
sw4064.dff	26	B	now I happen to know several judges and there is one that I would feel uncomfortable but has doing sentencing without the jury
sw4064.dff	28	B	I would feel a little bit uneasy about
sw4064.dff	30	B	but the other two I feel would give either the plaintiff or for the defendant the the full benefit of the law
sw4064.dff	32	B	And (I) (guess) that's what I am concerned with
sw4064.dff	33	A	(I) (guess) I definitely agree with you but (the) what I don't like about the jury doing the sentencing
sw4064.dff	35	A	in that I think it becomes a lot less the same crime gets unequal sentences
sw4064.dff	36	B	(This) (is) (very) (true)
sw4064.dff	37	A	I think there is more of an ability (you) (know) (you) (know) for selecting two different juries that would most of the time come up with the same idea versus whether he is guilty
sw4064.dff	39	A	or innocent
sw4064.dff	41	A	but I think there would be a large variation in trying to gage the severity of the crime and an appropriate punishment and have that measure stick across the board
sw4064.dff	42	B	and you do see such uneven sentencing
sw4064.dff	44	B	evidence of it in the newspapers and such
sw4064.dff	46	B	where it would appear the crimes were very similar but one individual got twenty-five years and the other one was sentenced to life
sw4064.dff	46	B	(So)
sw4064.dff	49	A	Of course a lot of that's also the ability of the defendant to get a good lawyer
sw4064.dff	50	B	(Isn't) (that) (the) (truth)
sw4064.dff	52	B	There are times when goodness (my) (mind) (has) (gone) (blank) (it's) Othello
sw4064.dff	52	B	You know where he says kill all the lawyers
sw4064.dff	54	B	Every now and then one is tempted (to) see what
sw4064.dff	55	A	(I) (agree)
sw4064.dff	56	B	But it's taken me a long time to understand that lawyers are concerned with the law and not with justice
sw4064.dff	58	B	as we think of as (as)
sw4064.dff	60	B	novices tend to think that attorneys care about justice
sw4064.dff	61	A	(I) (agree) (with) (it) They will admit to you that they don't have the benefit of being able of allowing themselves to believe their clients that are guilty
sw4064.dff	63	A	it's more of the game plan of how do they convince the judge or jury through argument
sw4064.dff	64	B	And
sw4064.dff	65	A	(That) (the)
sw4064.dff	66	B	they are very effective too
sw4064.dff	68	B	(even) I have been involved just slightly in a case where I know the person is guilty
sw4064.dff	70	B	but his attorneys gotten him off
sw4064.dff	72	B	the city has dropped their charges against him because the attorney has presented enough evidence of doubt to convince the judge
sw4064.dff	72	B	(So) (I) (don't) (know)
sw4064.dff	73	A	this is a little bit of the subject but one thing that I really dislike also that's new is that I have heard that there are federal sentences
sw4071.dff	1	A	Jackie on taxes (I) (guess) I would have to say that my opinion is that I do think American's are paying too much in taxes
sw4071.dff	1	A	what's your feeling about that
sw4071.dff	2	B	I agree
sw4071.dff	2	B	I think taxes are high
sw4071.dff	3	A	where you live do you have a state income tax and a sales tax both
sw4071.dff	4	B	yes
sw4071.dff	5	A	In New Hampshire we have (no) what we call broad base taxes
sw4071.dff	5	A	No income tax and no sales tax
sw4071.dff	7	A	we tax business eight percent (businesses) (are) (taxed) (eight) (percent) and we have what we call the five B s
sw4071.dff	7	A	for our taxes
sw4071.dff	7	A	Booze butts cigarettes beds hotel room tax
sw4071.dff	9	A	bellies a meal tax and bets gambling
sw4071.dff	11	A	So we do have a very low tax rate but combined with the federal income tax
sw4071.dff	11	A	I think that American's generally do pay too much in taxes (and)
sw4071.dff	12	B	I agree and I think it's about the time of the year when you just start getting (if) (you) (do) (get) money back from jobs I'm still a student
sw4071.dff	14	B	so I only work part time so I get a check back (so)
sw4071.dff	15	A	(that's) (nice)
sw4071.dff	16	B	from taxes (but)
sw4071.dff	17	A	(nice) (to) (get) (a) (refund)
sw4071.dff	18	B	(It) (is) (but) it's not much
sw4071.dff	18	B	(So)
sw4071.dff	19	A	Do you think that for whatever taxes we do pay that we are getting value for it
sw4071.dff	20	B	No
sw4071.dff	21	A	my opinion of taxes is that we just send money to Washington or to the state and they say they are going to send some back it's like (one) (arm) (giving) (the) (other) (a) (transfusion)
sw4071.dff	23	A	(You) (know) (what) (I) (mean)
sw4071.dff	25	A	(it) (really) (I) (should) (say) one arm giving another arm a transfusion through a leaky tube (because)
sw4071.dff	26	B	(There) (you) (go)
sw4071.dff	27	A	because there's an old saying in amongst taxes and politicians that there's a fly paper effect and that is that money tends to stick where it lands first and when you send it to Washington or send it to your state capitol a lot of it stays there and not that much comes back to you
sw4071.dff	30	B	(I) (don't) (know)
sw4071.dff	30	B	(I) don't seem like they are doing much with it there's plans there and now that they are voting and people getting into drug and that stuff
sw4071.dff	32	B	They have nice plans but they don't always work and then they try to raise taxes more and I don't what happens with all the money because if their plans don't work but taxes get raise (so)
sw4071.dff	32	B	(I) (don't) (know)
sw4071.dff	32	B	I'm not really into politics
sw4071.dff	33	A	(That) (it)
sw4071.dff	34	B	I don't really understand it
sw4071.dff	36	B	(but) (it's) (just)
sw4071.dff	37	A	it does seem that the more taxes that are raised the more the politicians spend
sw4071.dff	37	A	it's almost like they will spend as much as they're allowed to collect
sw4071.dff	39	A	there is an interesting proposal that's been going around now for a few years of having a flat tax
sw4071.dff	39	A	ten percent or thirteen percent
sw4071.dff	39	A	There would be no figuring
sw4071.dff	39	A	(you) (would) (take) (your) (income) (tax) (you) (would) (have) (a) (certain) (amount) you would take you total salary
sw4071.dff	41	A	those who made under a certain amount wouldn't owe any taxes and then there would be a set amount for however many (you) (know) dependent you have (and) (you) (would) (just) (pay) (a) (flat) (tax)
sw4071.dff	41	A	No exemptions no deductions or anything else (you) (know) (after) (you) (figure) (up) (who's) (in) (your) (family)
sw4071.dff	43	A	And that would eliminate a lot of the bureaucracy in the I R S and it would eliminate all these loop holes that the fat cats get away with
sw4071.dff	44	B	The could be nice
sw4071.dff	47	A	I'd like to see something like that
sw4071.dff	47	A	(I) (think) (it) (would) (be) (fairer) (and) it would put (you) (know) a lot of the tax attorneys our of business and I am sure they will fight it tooth and nail but I really think a flat tax would be a lot fairer for all Americans
sw4071.dff	49	A	it doesn't seem that somebody that makes twenty-five or thirty thousand dollars pays four or five thousand dollars in taxes while somebody that makes two hundred and fifty thousand dollars might pay nothing in taxes
sw4071.dff	51	A	(It) (doesn't) (seem) (fair) (to) (me)
sw4071.dff	52	B	(it) (isn't) there is not much out there that is fair that's for sure
sw4071.dff	54	B	I will agree to that
sw4071.dff	55	A	I think your taxes in Wisconsin are pretty high
sw4071.dff	55	A	if I am not mistaken aren't they
sw4071.dff	55	A	(I)
sw4071.dff	57	A	(mean) (for) (your) (state)
sw4071.dff	57	A	do you know what your state income tax rate is
sw4071.dff	58	B	no
sw4071.dff	59	A	Twenty percent
sw4071.dff	60	B	I have no idea (I) (just)
sw4071.dff	60	B	My dad does it all for me
sw4071.dff	61	A	you just pay it
sw4071.dff	62	B	(I) (use)
sw4071.dff	63	A	you're like my daughter who is in college down in Massachusetts and she works as a waitress and she is attending college full time also
sw4071.dff	65	A	and she sends her taxes to me and I figure them up
sw4071.dff	65	A	She really has no idea
sw4071.dff	65	A	She gets a refund check and
sw4072.dff	12	B	I think you pretty much have to listen to all news station to get any news at all
sw4072.dff	13	A	Do you think that T V is pretty accurate
sw4072.dff	13	A	sometimes do you think it gets pretty commercialized (or)
sw4072.dff	14	B	what I really don't like about T V especially local news as compared to national news is just it seems like everything is very spoon feed and it's more like the news shows is now an entertainment show like a sitcom
sw4072.dff	16	B	(or) (like) (the) (news) because they would always have the wonderful investigative reports is you're kids bus driver smoking crack
sw4072.dff	18	B	on the way to school
sw4072.dff	19	A	it's they mainly go with popular topics
sw4072.dff	21	A	just not basic news
sw4072.dff	22	B	also I have the observation with the press that any stories that I had any first hand knowledge of that I see in the press which only happened ten times in my life
sw4072.dff	24	B	first thing for (you) (know) anything that actually had more than just a blurb about it
sw4072.dff	24	B	the press has managed to just mess up some aspect of the story
sw4072.dff	26	B	it's something wrong
sw4072.dff	27	A	(Going) looks like they're going more for ratings than for
sw4072.dff	29	A	actual news
sw4072.dff	29	A	I think probably the best source of just plain journalism would be newspapers
sw4072.dff	31	A	(they) (typically) (have) (a) (better)
sw4072.dff	31	A	I am from a small town too here in Texas
sw4072.dff	33	A	that (like) local news is (really) who grew the biggest tomato (and)
sw4072.dff	34	B	(the) (farm) (report)
sw4072.dff	35	A	(farm) (report) and oil reports
sw4072.dff	37	A	That's pretty sad or who killed who
sw4072.dff	38	B	Also I have found that newspapers probably aren't as bad as television
sw4072.dff	38	B	Read the story and just found it so incredibly watered down (and)
sw4072.dff	39	A	(in) (Dallas) I don't know if you heard about the killing where the guy drove into Luby's (and) (the) (story) (was)
sw4072.dff	40	B	Was that he started shooting people in this cafeteria (or) (something)
sw4072.dff	41	A	(And) the news covered it
sw4072.dff	43	A	hours after it happened and they were taping people who were crying (who)
sw4072.dff	45	A	(had) (everything) (and) then (like) three days later this local news station was using as as their promo
sw4072.dff	47	A	to promote themselves
sw4072.dff	47	A	(I) (just) (thought) that's (kind) (of) cold
sw4072.dff	48	B	I have seen that happen lots of times
sw4072.dff	48	B	Channel X gives you the best coverage we were on the scene with our team players (and)
sw4072.dff	49	A	(and) (it) (was) (just) they were showing these dead people
sw4072.dff	51	A	and they were showing people crying
sw4072.dff	53	A	just taking advantage (of)
sw4072.dff	56	B	They are trying to get the most emotional response (for)
sw4072.dff	57	A	it didn't seem like there was much coverage of the story but just the play on people's emotions
sw4072.dff	57	A	(It's) (just) (gotten) (so) somewhere it's lost a lot of the quality that they use to have like in Walter Cronkite (that) (if)
sw4072.dff	59	A	and everything
sw4072.dff	60	B	I've (pretty) (much) stopped watching local news totally
sw4072.dff	62	B	even the national news I (just) find it to be
sw4072.dff	64	B	very watered down (very)
sw4072.dff	65	A	What did you think of the coverage of the war
sw4072.dff	66	B	I found it very one sided
sw4072.dff	67	A	(Did) (you)
sw4072.dff	68	B	it (just) seemed to lack any sort of debate
sw4072.dff	70	B	not saying that we actually should have been there or shouldn't have been there (but) (it) (just) (seemed) (like)
sw4072.dff	71	A	They kept just showing how great we were doing (and) (it) (never) (really) (showed) (what) (actually)
sw4074.dff	53	A	(But) it's a really good dog
sw4074.dff	55	A	(I) (don't) (know) they (seem) (I) (mean) listen better or something
sw4074.dff	57	A	Is your cat a purebred
sw4074.dff	58	B	(No)
sw4074.dff	58	B	No it's just an accident
sw4074.dff	60	B	From my son's friend down the street
sw4074.dff	60	B	They're
sw4074.dff	62	B	(they're) cat was an outside cat and just end up with some kittens (and) (so)
sw4074.dff	63	A	Would you ever want a dog in the family
sw4074.dff	64	B	I would
sw4074.dff	64	B	we had a dog that was a mix between an Alaska Malamute and a Labrador
sw4074.dff	66	B	and (I) (should) (say) (a) (pup) (and) he was just too big for our kids
sw4074.dff	68	B	when we got him and when we moved into our house that was the first thing we wanted to get (you) (know) was a pet and it was a dog that we gotten (and) (he) (was) (just) (too) (big)
sw4074.dff	70	B	the kids couldn't handle him and I was still going to school and my wife was working and I was working and so we just didn't have time to really train him (so) (you) (know) (he) (was) (too) (big) (for) (the) (kids) (to) (handle) so he was just tied up to a post
sw4074.dff	72	B	so we gave him to (I) (don't) (know) (if) (you've) (there) (is) a place out here called Shorties Lane (out) (here) in Harrisville
sw4074.dff	74	B	(and) (they) (have) (I) (guess) it's kind of an animal shelter but he just takes a few the animals in and some he destroys and some he keeps
sw4074.dff	76	B	So we took him up there and he ended up keeping him
sw4074.dff	76	B	cause he has had him for six or seven years
sw4074.dff	76	B	we've saw him just about a year ago and I thought (boy) that sure looks like that pup we gave away
sw4074.dff	78	B	and so we asked him about it one day and he said he's been the best dog I've ever had in my life
sw4074.dff	79	A	(Wow)
sw4074.dff	80	B	just goes everywhere with him
sw4074.dff	80	B	he would have been a (great) great dog
sw4074.dff	81	A	He just needed a lot of time
sw4077.dff	15	A	in most States as long as you aren't a convicted felon
sw4077.dff	17	A	or on probation or other obvious things (like) (that)
sw4077.dff	17	A	and (I) (know) (that) in a lot of states you could be just (like) released from a mental hospital the day before
sw4077.dff	17	A	be obviously insane (you) (know) but have your legal to get a gun
sw4077.dff	18	B	(I) (didn't) (know) (that)
sw4077.dff	18	B	that's pretty scary
sw4077.dff	18	B	(So) (now) do they want us to say where we feel about it in rating it one to ten
sw4077.dff	19	A	I'd (probably) say about a five
sw4077.dff	20	B	That's where I would (probably) be
sw4077.dff	21	A	Seems like it's a good safe number to pick
sw4077.dff	22	B	I don't (really) know how they can (really) enforce the laws any better
sw4077.dff	24	B	because I (do) think that some people need them (like) for protection (and) (stuff)
sw4077.dff	26	B	and I can understand them wanting to have them but then again (it's) (just) (like) all those nuts out there
sw4077.dff	27	A	(no-) (if) (you) (are) looking at country where they do have a lot more gun control like England and places (like) (that) the amount of violent crime has decreased (by) (so) (much)
sw4077.dff	28	B	(It) (has)
sw4077.dff	28	B	(Because) (then)
sw4077.dff	29	A	(the) (in) (comparing) per capita murders are incredibly lower than the United States
sw4077.dff	31	A	the problem (though) since the United States had this (pretty) (much) unrestricted flow of guns going for so long (that) (I) (think) if you were introduced any controls it would (probably) take a long while for them to take effect (just) because there is a glut of guns out there already
sw4077.dff	33	A	(so) it's (really) (kind) (of) a complex problem
sw4077.dff	34	B	is the crime that bad there in Atlanta
sw4077.dff	35	A	(I'm) (not) (really) (sure) (how) (bad) (it) (is)
sw4077.dff	35	A	I've not (really) had that many problems with it but apparently we were ranked pretty high up
sw4077.dff	36	B	(I) (know) (Dallas) (is)
sw4077.dff	37	A	(I) (think) (in) (the) (te-) I think we have been ranked in one of the top three for murders in the last few years
sw4077.dff	38	B	I don't know if Dallas is in the top three
sw4077.dff	40	B	(but)
sw4077.dff	40	B	Do you own a gun
sw4077.dff	41	A	No
sw4077.dff	41	A	I've thought about getting one
sw4077.dff	41	A	If I get one I think (I) (will) (probably) (get) (something)
sw4077.dff	41	A	I probably wouldn't get a hand gun
sw4077.dff	41	A	I would probably get a shotgun
sw4077.dff	41	A	Just for protecting myself
sw4077.dff	41	A	from
sw4077.dff	43	A	burglar type thing
sw4077.dff	43	A	I do kind of live in the downtown area
sw4077.dff	45	A	and shotguns are really good because they're somebody is not going to break in steal it and use it to mug someone
sw4077.dff	46	B	(That's) (true)
sw4077.dff	47	A	(and) (you) I just don't understand these people like when they decide they're going to buy a gun to protect themselves
sw4077.dff	47	A	They go out and buy a three fifty seven magnum (which) (is) (going) (to) (shoot) (through) they are probably going to miss the person and they're going to shoot through five wall
sw4077.dff	49	A	and hit someone a shotgun just really struck me as being a real good defensive weapon
sw4077.dff	49	A	You can sort of point it somewhere in the direction of
sw4077.dff	51	A	whoever
sw4077.dff	53	A	You pretty much stop them
sw4077.dff	53	A	And (you) (don't) then the actual shot doesn't go that far a wall will stop it pretty much
sw4077.dff	54	B	now when I first moved to Dallas I moved up here by myself and my Dad gave me a gun
sw4077.dff	56	B	but I never did go out and practice (with) (it) enough to feel comfortable with it
sw4077.dff	58	B	so I finally ended up giving it back to him
sw4077.dff	58	B	I said I don't want it
sw4077.dff	58	B	I don't want to be responsible for it because
sw4077.dff	60	B	if you're not going to teach me how to do it
sw4077.dff	62	B	and if I am not going to
sw4077.dff	64	B	be responsible enough to go out and learn I don't need it
sw4077.dff	65	A	that really does scare me
sw4077.dff	65	A	People that have guns because if you ever get in the situation where you are not prepared to shoot but you pick up the gun and point it at the person
sw4077.dff	67	A	that person rushes you
sw4077.dff	68	B	And they get it from you
sw4077.dff	69	A	And you're pretty much dead
sw4077.dff	71	A	Because you've just told the person that you're about to kill them then
sw4077.dff	72	B	(Set) (them) (off)
sw4077.dff	73	A	(and) you basically made it clear to the person you know unless that you are a real danger to them and then if they manage to get the gun from you their first reaction is going to you know stop you
sw4077.dff	74	B	that's why I ended up giving it back to him
sw4077.dff	74	B	(I) (thought)
sw4077.dff	76	B	(I) (don't) (want) (it) (you) (know) (if) (I) (don't) (really) (know) (how) (to) (use) (it)
sw4077.dff	78	B	and I just didn't want the responsibility
sw4077.dff	80	B	So
sw4077.dff	80	B	did you hear about that Killeen massacre or whatever
sw4077.dff	81	A	did it happen at a cafeteria or something
sw4077.dff	82	B	That kind of
sw4077.dff	84	B	it just makes you wonder how people get guns
sw4077.dff	84	B	I would be scared selling guns to people
sw4078.dff	16	B	And they were recycled cardboard
sw4078.dff	16	B	They were eight and a half by eleven and you set it by your desk and as you got rid of a piece of paper you stuck it in there and when it filled up you called facilities whoever to come pick it up and they brought you another box
sw4078.dff	16	B	So not only is it I think more people would take advantage of it and use it I think you save a lot of the cleaning service's time and effort and money that we are paying for them to empty the trash cans and combine it and bundle it and things like that now when it could all be done in one step
sw4078.dff	18	B	kind of type thing
sw4078.dff	19	A	(I) (see)
sw4078.dff	20	B	(So)
sw4078.dff	21	A	I was going to say cause I know I have here a trash can for trash and (a) (trash) (can) for paper on it
sw4078.dff	23	A	(and) (if)
sw4078.dff	24	B	(If)
sw4078.dff	25	A	if (I) (have) (a) (if) (I) (I) printed up something that I don't need it just chunk it in the in the paper
sw4078.dff	26	B	but somebody still has to collect all that
sw4078.dff	27	A	(That's) (true)
sw4078.dff	28	B	and bundle it together and whereas if you had a box that pretty soon it got full you close the box it's already bundled it's (already) done for you
sw4078.dff	29	A	(Certainly) (that's) (a) (good) (idea)
sw4078.dff	30	B	So you're saving a lot of time and effort
sw4078.dff	30	B	I just need to put it on paper and
sw4078.dff	32	B	(I) (guess) recommended it to somebody and see if they thinks it's feasible
sw4078.dff	34	B	So what else do they do in the Dallas area
sw4078.dff	35	A	as far as T I is concerned I'm not sure
sw4078.dff	35	A	and I have heard in residential situations
sw4078.dff	35	A	I live in a dorm (and) (I) (have) (heard) (in) (residential) (situations) like in Plano
sw4078.dff	37	A	that they are doing stuff like having recycle picked up
sw4078.dff	39	A	where I guess the sanitation department as part of their responsibility picks up the recycled items as well the plastics and the paper and aluminum and (the) (only) (responsibility) (of) (the) patron is to separate them and then the I guess the department takes them and does what they do with them and it doesn't cost the patron anything
sw4078.dff	39	A	Doesn't really cost the department
sw4078.dff	40	B	(Anything) (extra)
sw4078.dff	41	A	they don't pay for the recycled items
sw4078.dff	42	B	That sounds good
sw4078.dff	42	B	(There's) I've been wanting to put like two of three bins out my garage door where from the kitchen where you can throw cans in one or the glass in the other or the even there are areas that can recycle the tin cans (like) (your)
sw4079.dff	1	A	Okay
sw4079.dff	1	A	Frank what type of budget do you or your family have
sw4079.dff	2	B	(I) (don't) (know) (that) (we) (really) (have) (a) (budget)
sw4079.dff	2	B	(I) (have) (a) (set) (amount) (that) (I) (save)
sw4079.dff	2	B	(well) (actually) (there) (is) (a) (way) (budget) (our) (money) (apparently)
sw4079.dff	2	B	(The) my wife gets so much to do shopping with every couple of weeks and we allot each of us so much money per week for our personal stuff gas and things like that and besides that (you) (know) I have a set amount that I save every month
sw4079.dff	3	A	That's sounds like probably a tighter controlled budget than what I have
sw4079.dff	5	A	I am single (so)
sw4079.dff	7	A	(I) (guess) I don't know if that's an excuse for not having a tight budget (but) (I) (basically)
sw4079.dff	8	B	Really don't need to
sw4079.dff	9	A	(I) (don't) (need) (to)
sw4079.dff	9	A	I am the only that I have to keep track of so it makes it a little bit easier
sw4079.dff	10	B	(That's)
sw4079.dff	11	A	and also (you) (know) I try to save a certain amount each month as well
sw4079.dff	13	A	and I try to have an idea of what my expenses are and I am pretty consistent from month to month
sw4079.dff	15	A	and whenever that changes I am pretty well aware of it without actually having to maintain a budget for it
sw4079.dff	16	B	(I) (found) (that) (things) (as) (I) (have) (gotten) (older) I am in my fifties now but before we use to have a very strict budget I had four kids and we planned out how much we were going to spend for food and how much for this and for that
sw4079.dff	16	B	Kind of anticipate how much things were going to be
sw4079.dff	16	B	I guess one interesting aspect of the budgeting I do now is that I (kind) (of) fence off areas of my check book
sw4079.dff	16	B	For instance there are certain things that I know come up every so often
sw4079.dff	16	B	Every six months I have to pay car insurance
sw4079.dff	16	B	every six months I have to pay my taxes
sw4079.dff	16	B	(So)
sw4079.dff	18	B	I take a set amount
sw4079.dff	18	B	I've got a money market account that I do a lot of saving in and I also have got a checking account besides that but what I do on my money market account my taxes for instance which amount to an average of two hundred and twenty dollars a month
sw4079.dff	18	B	I will just take two hundred and twenty out and I put it in parenthesis
sw4079.dff	18	B	I take it out of the line total
sw4079.dff	20	B	and put it in parenthesis in there and let it build up
sw4079.dff	20	B	Every month I add two hundred and twenty dollars to it
sw4079.dff	20	B	Then when the tax bill comes in I've got that much set aside
sw4079.dff	22	B	And I guess that's a way of budgeting
sw4079.dff	23	A	(That's) I guess I kind of do a similar thing
sw4079.dff	23	A	More medium or longer range
sw4079.dff	23	A	I just have (a) (maybe) a targeted amount that I will save for
sw4079.dff	23	A	(I) (am) probably within a year I would like to buy a new car
sw4079.dff	25	A	(So) I (kind) (of) have an amount in my mind and I am making every effort to put a little bit away and increase the amount that I need for a down payment (or) (whatever)
sw4079.dff	26	B	cars are definitely something that you have to figure into your budget
sw4079.dff	26	B	Not only for buying them but for keeping them on the road too
sw4079.dff	28	B	we've got two cars
sw4079.dff	28	B	My wife has a car and I like to drive pick up truck
sw4079.dff	28	B	So we are on a schedule where I try every three or four years to buy a new one
sw4079.dff	28	B	And I am constantly making car payments but I figure that's got to be the story of my life (is) (making) (car) (payments)
sw4079.dff	30	B	So I get one paid for and (actually) (I) (am) (saving) (up) (for) (another) (one) (besides) (so)
sw4079.dff	32	B	(you) (know) it's (kind) (of) a never ending thing but
sw4079.dff	34	B	you try to schedule those things so that you're not paying for two at the same time
sw4079.dff	36	B	(I) (guess) (is) (what) (I) (am) (saying)
sw4079.dff	37	A	Have you thought about leasing
sw4079.dff	38	B	I have thought about it (but) (leasing) (wouldn't) I don't use it for my business
sw4079.dff	39	A	(I) (see)
sw4079.dff	40	B	My wife uses hers (just) for pleasure and I use mine (just) to go back and forth to work
sw4079.dff	42	B	which is only ten miles away (so)
sw4079.dff	43	A	But if you are rolling it over every three years
sw4079.dff	45	A	it might be advantageous to do that
sw4079.dff	46	B	(I) (guess)
sw4079.dff	47	A	typically if you purchase your own car you tend to make the best returns after you pay it off
sw4079.dff	49	A	Of course the longer you keep it beyond that point the more profitable it is to own it yourself
sw4079.dff	50	B	you're I have been know to keep trucks or cars for ten or twelve years but I find that after about four years they (kind) (of) start going down hill and you got to put (put) stuff in them
sw4079.dff	51	A	(That's) mine's seven years old and I think last year that was a rough year for it
sw4079.dff	51	A	I had a number of expenses
sw4079.dff	53	A	But I am hoping that most of them were just kind of (the) as you get to a certain number of miles you have to get everything replaced brakes shocks and all that
sw4079.dff	53	A	So I just went through that whole set last year
sw4079.dff	55	A	I hope that I only have a slow period before I do that again
sw4079.dff	56	B	Those things can really upset your budget when they come in
sw4079.dff	56	B	it's nice to have a little bit set aside for the unexpected (shall) (we) say
sw4079.dff	58	B	So that it doesn't kill you all in one month
sw4079.dff	59	A	What line of work are you in
sw4080.dff	1	A	(Okay)
sw4080.dff	2	B	(All)
sw4080.dff	3	A	What's your view
sw4080.dff	5	A	(What's) (your) (view)
sw4080.dff	6	B	I have a hard time thinking that they can control guns
sw4080.dff	8	B	Personally
sw4080.dff	9	A	(that's) (true)
sw4080.dff	11	A	even if they give it a shot it's still going to be black market all over the place
sw4080.dff	12	B	(That's) (That's)
sw4080.dff	13	A	(I) (don't) (know)
sw4080.dff	13	A	Coming from Texas (you're) (probably) I don't know I shouldn't make stereo types but gun control is probably frowned on quite a bit down there I would think
sw4080.dff	14	B	It is but I'm not really from Texas I just live down here now
sw4080.dff	14	B	(I've)
sw4080.dff	15	A	you're just live down there
sw4080.dff	16	B	I've lived down here a couple years
sw4080.dff	18	B	I'm originally from Colorado but
sw4080.dff	20	B	there's a lot of hunters here
sw4080.dff	21	A	(I) (know) (how) (you) (feel)
sw4080.dff	21	A	I grew up in Nebraska and we always use to go out and hunt all the time and
sw4080.dff	23	A	(man) There's no way I would ever go for a total ban on all weapons
sw4080.dff	23	A	(That's) (just) (I) (don't) (know)
sw4080.dff	24	B	I think it's ridiculous
sw4080.dff	27	A	It doesn't sit with me very well
sw4080.dff	27	A	(I) (don't) (know) (anymore) I keep a thirty-eight in my truck
sw4080.dff	28	B	(Really)
sw4080.dff	29	A	(I) (just) (about) (all) I live in Minneapolis and (I) (I) (live) in Florida but I am staying in Minneapolis for a year and
sw4080.dff	31	A	both areas are pretty crime ridden now
sw4080.dff	33	A	and (it's) (just) you never know who is out there
sw4080.dff	35	A	it's just for self protection purposes and then of course there's the hunting issue (so)
sw4080.dff	36	B	(Sure)
sw4080.dff	37	A	(that's) (good)
sw4080.dff	37	A	What do you do Jeff
sw4080.dff	38	B	I'm in program control for a company up here
sw4080.dff	41	A	(All)
sw4080.dff	42	B	We do schedules for
sw4080.dff	44	B	programs (schedule) (programs)
sw4080.dff	44	B	What do you do
sw4080.dff	45	A	I'm researcher of Honeywell up here
sw4080.dff	46	B	(okay)
sw4080.dff	47	A	(You) (guys) do you get much of a chance to hunt (or) (anything) (or)
sw4080.dff	48	B	I haven't had a chance to do any hunting since I've been down here
sw4080.dff	48	B	I don't own a shotgun but I'd like to go bird hunting
sw4080.dff	51	A	that's something I miss quite a bit
sw4080.dff	52	B	when I was in Colorado we went deer and elk hunting
sw4080.dff	54	B	(you) (know) quite a bit (but)
sw4080.dff	55	A	(All) my brother was a guide for bear and elk hunts out in Idaho for a while and really enjoyed it quite a bit but I don't know
sw4080.dff	55	A	I guess that what the scale now is it's zero for a complete
sw4080.dff	56	B	One for a total ban
sw4080.dff	57	A	(That's)
sw4080.dff	58	B	(and)
sw4080.dff	59	A	I guess I am about eight or nine
sw4080.dff	60	B	I agree with you there
sw4080.dff	61	A	no doubt about it (but)
sw4080.dff	62	B	if they can anyway get it keep criminals from having guns which they can't
sw4080.dff	64	B	you know (I'm) (not)
sw4080.dff	65	A	(if) (there's)
sw4080.dff	66	B	(for) (it)
sw4080.dff	67	A	(if) (there's) (a) (way) (to) (limited) (it) (to) (people) (that) (I) (don't) (know) (that) (they) I guess they passed a couple of laws (a) (here) (while) (back) in some states in terms of a waiting period
sw4080.dff	69	A	where you go to buy a hand gun (and) (then) (they) (actually) I know it's this way in Florida
sw4080.dff	69	A	They have a waiting period where you buy one and that's a week
sw4080.dff	71	A	and then they check you out and make sure you don't have a record (and) (things) (like) (that)
sw4080.dff	71	A	I think that's a pretty good idea
sw4080.dff	71	A	(and) (that's) (I) (don't) (know) (that's) (not) (a) (bad) (idea) but then again you can always get around that
sw4080.dff	71	A	You could go through the black market like you say
sw4080.dff	71	A	you always be able to get around but
sw4080.dff	72	B	(Sure)
sw4080.dff	73	A	(it's) (one) (of) (things) (but) (I) (don't) (know)
sw4080.dff	73	A	(I) (guess) some forms of guns should (probably) be controlled (just) (like) I'm not (real) sure why anybody would need a full automatic weapon
sw4080.dff	74	B	(I) (don't) (either)
sw4080.dff	75	A	(I'm) (just) (not) I think those have been pretty much banned altogether (anyway)
sw4080.dff	76	B	(I)
sw4080.dff	77	A	(There)
sw4080.dff	78	B	fully auto but even a semiautomatic (I) (guess) (that's)
sw4080.dff	79	A	It kind of takes the sport out of hunting
sw4080.dff	81	A	(it's) (like) what can you do with that that you can't do in a self protection situation with (like) a seven or a twenty shot twelve
sw4080.dff	82	B	(Sure)
sw4080.dff	83	A	you might do the same thing
sw4080.dff	85	A	(And) (so) (it's) (like) (I) (don't) (know)
sw4080.dff	85	A	(It) (does)
sw4080.dff	85	A	(It) (takes) (the) (sport) (out) (of) (it)
sw4080.dff	85	A	For me I would much rather have a bow anytime
sw4080.dff	86	B	(really)
sw4080.dff	87	A	I like bows
sw4080.dff	87	A	I have done some bow hunting and I get into it and I think it's more of a challenge
sw4080.dff	89	A	But I don't know
sw4080.dff	89	A	I guess it keeps the shell makers in business
sw4080.dff	90	B	(Sure)
sw4080.dff	91	A	(But) (I) (don't) (know)
sw4080.dff	91	A	that's about where I stand
sw4080.dff	92	B	Me too
sw4080.dff	93	A	(You)
sw4080.dff	94	B	I am about the same way
sw4080.dff	95	A	And have you eaten yet (or) (whatever)
sw4080.dff	97	A	Is it seven o'clock there
sw4080.dff	98	B	it's about seven fifteen
sw4080.dff	99	A	You guys central
sw4080.dff	100	B	How is the weather up there
sw4080.dff	101	A	it's not too good
sw4080.dff	101	A	It's kind of rainy
sw4080.dff	102	B	(Is) (it)
sw4080.dff	103	A	Around this time of year you expect it up here to get down to about (I) (don't) (know) ten or twenty degrees
sw4080.dff	105	A	and it's been up around forty
sw4080.dff	105	A	So people are whining about the rain and stuff but not too bad about the temperature
sw4080.dff	105	A	Ice is starting to melt and stuff like that (so)
sw4080.dff	107	A	I am just up here for the year and it's kind of shocking
sw4082.dff	11	A	(I-)
sw4082.dff	12	B	(so) I can read a certain business or topics
sw4082.dff	13	A	is it
sw4082.dff	15	A	(is) (it) the A P news wire or is it something that is a little bit different from that
sw4082.dff	16	B	it's similar to that but it's DOW JONES which is the WALL STREET JOURNALS news wire
sw4082.dff	17	A	(okay)
sw4082.dff	17	A	(So) that's interesting
sw4082.dff	17	A	(Okay)
sw4082.dff	17	A	I had access in the past to the A P news wire and I thought that was a pretty good way to get news
sw4082.dff	17	A	I've never used the DOW JONES news wire but it do you read any news magazines or anything like that for sort of a broader more long term analytical sort of approach
sw4082.dff	18	B	actually not
sw4082.dff	18	B	I do follow I don't know how to describe it so I'll say a religious newspaper which talks about issues that are relevant to me in a more broad sense
sw4082.dff	18	B	It's a weekly
sw4082.dff	20	B	but not like BUSINESS WEEK or NEWS WEEK or one of those kinds of things
sw4082.dff	20	B	I'd like to say however that I'm overwhelmingly disappointed with the media in general except for the raw news wires
sw4082.dff	21	A	In what way
sw4082.dff	21	A	in sort of quality or sort of an orientation in terms of view point or the way the news is presented or whatever
sw4082.dff	22	B	I think that it has to do with (I) (personally) (think) I have a problem with their viewpoint (and) (I) (personally) (think) (that) (ther-)
sw4082.dff	23	A	you won't offend me
sw4082.dff	23	A	So go ahead and say
sw4082.dff	24	B	that there's a strong (bia-) (there's) (a) (strong) bias in the media
sw4082.dff	25	A	(Like) (a) (liberal) (type) (of) (bias)
sw4082.dff	26	B	(Absolutely)
sw4082.dff	26	B	after all who writes
sw4082.dff	26	B	People who are journalist who are trained to write and that's a liberal field
sw4082.dff	28	B	at least from academia and the other thing that I always notice is that whenever they write about something that I'm an expert in I find their descriptions to be wrong
sw4082.dff	30	B	(and) (it)
sw4082.dff	31	A	they generally make mistake on anything technical at least
sw4082.dff	32	B	That's even if it's not technical
sw4082.dff	32	B	If it's some social thing or whatever
sw4082.dff	32	B	It doesn't matter
sw4082.dff	32	B	If I am an expert in it they usually make mistakes which makes me think I'm not expert in it
sw4082.dff	32	B	They're telling me lies
sw4082.dff	33	A	by mistakes do you mean just like honest mistakes or do you think they are deliberate sorts of things
sw4082.dff	34	B	I think both
sw4082.dff	34	B	by deliberate I mean mistakes of omission or biased toward (a) (particular) (view) (point)
sw4082.dff	36	B	a particular liberal
sw4082.dff	38	B	view point that they have
sw4082.dff	40	B	to give you an example we will go out of the printing media
sw4082.dff	40	B	I know of cases where we have one television media where they will show clippings from one event and describe another event but with the attempt to give you the impression that what they're talking about is the same thing they are showing you
sw4082.dff	42	B	Which is sort of like a deliberate bias
sw4082.dff	43	A	(That's) (disturbing)
sw4082.dff	44	B	which is rather disturbing
sw4082.dff	44	B	he does that
sw4082.dff	45	A	I haven't really noticed them doing that but (whatever) again I don't watch T V news that much now
sw4082.dff	45	A	If I had access to C N N I would watch T V news more
sw4082.dff	45	A	(you) (know) but I don't usually
sw4082.dff	46	B	I don't have access either
sw4082.dff	46	B	Although I did at one time (and) (it) (was) (I) (did) during the Gulf War and it was addictive
sw4082.dff	47	A	did you think that (well) the Gulf War coverage would be (kind) (of) an abnormality
sw4082.dff	47	A	(I) (just) (wonde-) (I) (guess)
sw4082.dff	47	A	I would be curious to know what you thought as to how C N N T V news compared to the three networks
sw4082.dff	47	A	whether you thought it was more of a biased (or) (whatever) but I guess you wouldn't
sw4082.dff	47	A	(You) (probably) if you just watched it during the Gulf War that probably wouldn't tell you much
sw4082.dff	48	B	during that small sample I would think that everyone was just about the same except the three networks radio television programming
sw4082.dff	50	B	So if at a particular time you wanted to get the latest and greatest news
sw4082.dff	52	B	you could do that by turning on C N N and you
sw4090.dff	1	A	(Okay) Eric
sw4090.dff	1	A	are you married and do you have a family
sw4090.dff	2	B	yes I am to both questions
sw4090.dff	3	A	(Okay) and do you and your wife have a budget plan for your finances
sw4090.dff	4	B	we do
sw4090.dff	4	B	(We) (basically) there's you know the expenses that are fixed during the month
sw4090.dff	6	B	the ones that come every month and we enter those into a spread sheet and whatever is left after that we
sw4090.dff	8	B	(we) sit down and agree on kind of what what sort of range we are going to
sw4090.dff	10	B	generally going to shoot for
sw4090.dff	11	A	(I) (see)
sw4090.dff	12	B	what do you do
sw4090.dff	13	A	that's basically what we do
sw4090.dff	13	A	about every three months or so we re-evaluate our budget and we sit down and just write from the largest bills down to the smallest
sw4090.dff	15	A	and then we divvy them up between our four pay checks
sw4090.dff	15	A	I work part time at night
sw4090.dff	16	B	(Wow)
sw4090.dff	17	A	and my husband works full times days and so we have four checks but that works out nice because we get paid every week and
sw4090.dff	19	A	so that does help
sw4090.dff	21	A	that helps a lot
sw4090.dff	21	A	And then we don't have a lot extra for extra spending
sw4090.dff	23	A	so it's pretty well ear marked
sw4090.dff	24	B	All allocated out
sw4090.dff	27	A	Every penny is ear marked but we have found that works the best and so if we can just divide all the major bills up
sw4090.dff	27	A	In fact we found it easier to divide the major bills up cut the house payment in half and cut the loan payment in half and divide those up between all
sw4090.dff	28	B	All the checks
sw4090.dff	29	A	And so we are not taking a huge sum out of one and then the next pay check we're real short (or)
sw4090.dff	30	B	we found that
sw4090.dff	32	B	it's definitely helped get a handle on kind of the unnecessary expenses
sw4090.dff	33	A	(That's) (true)
sw4090.dff	34	B	before we started doing that kind of a thing we were spending money for things that we kind of tended to eat out a bit more
sw4090.dff	36	B	than we should have
sw4090.dff	38	B	and it was easy to let things get out of hand
sw4090.dff	38	B	We thought it to be really helpful
sw4090.dff	38	B	We have gotten some of our loans paid off really
sw4090.dff	40	B	because of this and stuff like that (so)
sw4090.dff	41	A	it helps you to focus where your money goes
sw4090.dff	43	A	and I am sure you felt the same frustration before you got on a budget but you're wondering when you put down all the money that you do bring in (and) (then) (you're) (saying) (my) (word) (where) (did) (all) (that) (money)
sw4090.dff	44	B	That's a lot of money (but)
sw4090.dff	45	A	(go)
sw4090.dff	45	A	Where does it go
sw4090.dff	48	B	(But)
sw4090.dff	49	A	and also we have found that if we write down and we did this
sw4090.dff	49	A	We are not real consistent with this but we did it for about a month and we wrote down everything that we bought you know every pay check
sw4090.dff	51	A	and so we could see where every penny went and it was really interesting to see just what you do spend and like I say we haven't been real consistent with it
sw4090.dff	51	A	It's we should cause it does help
sw4090.dff	52	B	the other thing that we've found that helps is we tend to fudge on the budget a little bit
sw4090.dff	54	B	it's just to get up the money in advance and put it in so long as it wasn't unreasonably high but for things like food expenses
sw4090.dff	56	B	(or) (whatever)
sw4090.dff	56	B	Just put it in
sw4090.dff	58	B	in an envelope or whatever and that way it kind of forced us to stick to that amount
sw4090.dff	59	A	(just) (stick) (to) (that) (That) (is)
sw4090.dff	60	B	And then once that was gone
sw4090.dff	62	B	if the entertainment amount was gone
sw4090.dff	63	A	(That)
sw4090.dff	64	B	for the month (say) it's gone
sw4090.dff	65	A	that sounds like a really good idea
sw4090.dff	67	A	And (it) really helpful
sw4090.dff	67	A	have you developed a savings plan or I R A s or anything like that yet
sw4090.dff	68	B	we haven't
sw4090.dff	68	B	our initial goal was just to completely retire debt for car payments and
sw4090.dff	70	B	credit card
sw4090.dff	72	B	credit card debt and all of that
sw4090.dff	72	B	We are just at a point where where we could start thinking about it (so)
sw4090.dff	73	A	(that's) (good)
sw4090.dff	73	A	(That's) (a) (good) (feeling)
sw4090.dff	74	B	(I)
sw4090.dff	75	A	My husband just graduated from the university a year ago
sw4090.dff	77	A	(so) (finally)
sw4090.dff	78	B	(A) (student)
sw4090.dff	79	A	finally we are getting to that point too
sw4090.dff	79	A	are you still going to school (or)
sw4090.dff	80	B	I am actually (in) (the) (mas-)
sw4092.dff	26	B	(Okay)
sw4092.dff	29	A	(we'll) (have) (to)
sw4092.dff	30	B	(What) (kind) (of)
sw4092.dff	31	A	I have a lot of friends that like country music
sw4092.dff	32	B	What kind of rock music do you listen to
sw4092.dff	32	B	Do you listen to that really heavy metal stuff (or)
sw4092.dff	33	A	No I'm more into older rock like the psychedelic era (like)
sw4092.dff	34	B	Seventies and (like) that stuff
sw4092.dff	35	A	late sixties seventies
sw4092.dff	37	A	Greatful Dead Crosby Stills and Nash
sw4092.dff	38	B	I have friends that like that
sw4092.dff	39	A	What
sw4092.dff	42	B	you have never heard of the Christian music that I listen to probably
sw4092.dff	43	A	I've heard a little bit of it
sw4092.dff	43	A	(I've) (just)
sw4092.dff	44	B	have you heard of Carmen
sw4092.dff	44	B	Have you ever heard of Kim
sw4092.dff	45	A	I've heard of Striper
sw4092.dff	45	A	(So) (the) (only) (one) (I) (can)
sw4092.dff	46	B	Striper they're the really heavy
sw4092.dff	48	B	the heavy metal stuff
sw4092.dff	50	B	(I) (guess)
sw4092.dff	51	A	the first of Amy Grant before
sw4092.dff	53	A	(you) (know) became more mainstream top forty
sw4092.dff	54	B	Cause she plays both secular and Christian (so)
sw4092.dff	56	B	I like her too
sw4092.dff	58	B	I have been to a concert a couple of times of hers
sw4092.dff	59	A	I've never actually seen her in concert
sw4092.dff	59	A	I imagine that she puts on a pretty good show
sw4092.dff	60	B	She does
sw4092.dff	62	B	She's real good
sw4092.dff	62	B	(So) I like her
sw4092.dff	65	A	I like some country music
sw4092.dff	65	A	(It's) (just) (that) (I) (like) (finding) (a) (lot) (of) (it's)
sw4092.dff	66	B	I don't like the country music that's like my wife left me my dog
sw4092.dff	68	B	left me everybody's left me
sw4092.dff	69	A	Mama got run over by the train
sw4092.dff	70	B	I don't like that
sw4092.dff	72	B	I like Randy Travis
sw4092.dff	74	B	I like more of the real new ones
sw4092.dff	75	A	Like Garth Brooks
sw4092.dff	76	B	Garth Brooks yes he's fine
sw4092.dff	77	A	Reba MacIntyre
sw4092.dff	78	B	I like them
sw4092.dff	78	B	I don't care for the older the dog left me stuff
sw4092.dff	79	A	You don't like Patsy Cline
sw4092.dff	81	A	(You) (don't) (like) (Patsy) (Cline)
sw4092.dff	82	B	No I don't even really know who she is ()
sw4092.dff	84	B	But have you ever been to any (of) (them) concerts that you like
sw4092.dff	84	B	(That) (music) (that) (you) (like) (to)
sw4092.dff	85	A	actually I just went to see the Greatful Dead (I) (guess) about a week ago
sw4092.dff	86	B	But aren't they done (with)
sw4092.dff	86	B	(I) (thought) (that) (they)
sw4092.dff	87	A	No (they) (are) (still) (on) (tour)
sw4092.dff	87	A	They have been touring
sw4092.dff	89	A	since the late sixties
sw4092.dff	90	B	(And) (I) (just) (thought) (that) (they) (done) (broke) (up) (and)
sw4092.dff	91	A	(No)
sw4092.dff	92	B	(left)
sw4092.dff	93	A	They're still together
sw4092.dff	93	A	They're still
sw4092.dff	95	A	making albums
sw4092.dff	96	B	(Wow) (I) (didn't) (know) (that)
sw4092.dff	100	B	(That's) (interesting)
sw4092.dff	101	A	(In) (fact) there are people that (basically) (just) follow them around (from) (city) (to) (city)
sw4092.dff	103	A	on tour selling tie dye (and) (things) (like) (that)
sw4092.dff	106	B	(Cause) they are on up there in age aren't they
sw4092.dff	107	A	they're (like) late forties early fifties but whenever one of them dies off they get a replacement
sw4092.dff	108	B	(Okay)
sw4092.dff	110	B	(Alright)
sw4092.dff	111	A	they seem to have a really bad time with keyboard players
sw4092.dff	111	A	They keep on dying and they keep on replacing them and the new ones in this thirties
sw4092.dff	112	B	(alright)
sw4092.dff	113	A	(But)
sw4092.dff	114	B	Cause they look pretty rough
sw4092.dff	114	B	(I've) (seen) (picture) (of) (them) (and) (they) (just)
sw4092.dff	115	A	they don't actually look as rough as the Rolling Stones
sw4092.dff	115	A	(They) (just) I don't know if you saw the tour posters of the Rolling Stones when they last toured but it looked like leather day at the geriatric
sw4092.dff	118	B	(cause) (they) (just)
sw4092.dff	119	A	All their faces were just all shriveled
sw4092.dff	120	B	(Yuck) (looking)
sw4092.dff	123	A	it just (just) looked like they
sw4092.dff	125	A	got a bunch of retirees and put them in leather jackets and blue jeans
sw4092.dff	126	B	are you into that rock music all that druggy stuff (and) (all) (that)
sw4092.dff	130	B	You know what I am saying I mean like they come on the stage and you they don't even know they are there
sw4092.dff	130	B	They are just so out of it
sw4092.dff	131	A	Actually I prefer my performers to be pretty sober just so if they're jamming that they don't just lose themselves and go into lala land
sw4092.dff	134	B	So I just don't like
sw4092.dff	136	B	That
sw4092.dff	136	B	So I don't know
sw4092.dff	137	A	have you seen any concerts lately
sw4096.dff	1	A	Hello Ann
sw4096.dff	2	B	Hello Chuck
sw4096.dff	3	A	the other day I attended a conference here at Utah State University on recycling
sw4096.dff	5	A	and I was (kind) (of) interested to hear cause they had some people from the E P A and lots of different places
sw4096.dff	7	A	and they had basically decided that there is going to be a real problem here within a few years on solid waste
sw4096.dff	8	B	I didn't think that was a new revelation
sw4096.dff	9	A	(it's) (not) (too) (new)
sw4096.dff	10	B	what is the E P A recommending now
sw4096.dff	11	A	they really didn't propose any solutions
sw4096.dff	11	A	the guy was pretty negative about the things that the government was doing even though he was from the E P A
sw4096.dff	13	A	But he had a lot of facts to give (and) (things) like how many solid waste plants were being shut down and one of the most interesting things that he was talking about was recycling of news print
sw4096.dff	13	A	He was talking about the City of New York and how they went and collected all this news print
sw4096.dff	15	A	and they could sell it for a while
sw4096.dff	15	A	(They) (were) (able) (to) (sell) (it) for some amount per ton and now (at) (this) (stage) (of) (the) (game) (where) they have gotten into recycling they've collected so much news print that they have to pay to have it hauled away
sw4096.dff	16	B	that's a common problem though
sw4096.dff	16	B	that has happened in Dallas as well as New York and I try to recycle all of the newspapers that come to my house and after a while I just quit taking the newspaper because I couldn't recycle it anymore which isn't good for business on the other end either (I) (suppose)
sw4096.dff	17	A	We're doing some here in Cash Valley (the) (community) (here)
sw4096.dff	19	A	we've actually got a kind of a nice set up
sw4096.dff	19	A	We've got a couple of plants here that actually take recycled paper and shred it and spray it with chemical treatment so that it's not a fire hazard
sw4096.dff	21	A	and make it into insulation and they can actually use as much recycled paper as the community can get to them
sw4096.dff	21	A	Because they are actually buying it and shipping it in from outside
sw4096.dff	22	B	(that's) (good)
sw4096.dff	23	A	So one of the real keys (it) (sounds) (like) to getting recycling for paper (or) (something) (like) (that) to go is to get some sort of business to actually want it once you have collected it
sw4096.dff	24	B	There has to be a reuse for it
sw4096.dff	24	B	that's why they recycle
sw4096.dff	24	B	(The) (one) (I) (think) (is) (the) (most) (interesting) (is) with the recycled bottles (and) (all) (that) the industry seems to be doing with the recycled polymers
sw4096.dff	24	B	everything from waste baskets to (carpet) (to) (I) (mean) the sticky slide rugs under the carpet
sw4096.dff	26	B	and (I) (think) they are even putting it in the roadways these days and they're making clothes now that are recycled
sw4096.dff	26	B	(Like) (the) (recycled) (plastic) (coke) (bottles) (and) (milk) (cartons) (and) (things) (like) (that)
sw4096.dff	27	A	And there was a paper presented at this conference from a guy from Alabama and he was (kind) (of) hired to do a study by two departments for the government
sw4096.dff	27	A	One was environmental protection and the other one (was) (I) (can't) (remember) (what) (but) the basic idea it was presented to him was how can we maximize the amount of energy that we can get back from recycling and minimize the volume of stuff that we are putting into our landfill
sw4096.dff	29	A	and the solution that he came up with for plastics it was really quite amazing he says the best thing to do with plastics is to burn them
sw4096.dff	30	B	(really)
sw4096.dff	31	A	He came to the conclusion plastics is actually one of the biggest problems in landfills cause it's low weight but it's high volume so it takes up a lot of space
sw4096.dff	33	A	and there's very little energy value in actually doing a lot of the recycling but there is a lot of energy in it if you can burn it and use it produce electricity
sw4096.dff	35	A	So his solution was to burn plastic
sw4096.dff	35	A	Collect it and burn it
sw4096.dff	36	B	it's carbon so that makes sense a carbon fuel of some sort (but)
sw4096.dff	38	B	(what)
sw4096.dff	39	A	And it's more than even paper or something like that
sw4096.dff	39	A	There is more energy in it per pound or whatever
sw4096.dff	40	B	what about emissions
sw4096.dff	41	A	he didn't deal with that
sw4096.dff	43	A	He just said burn it
sw4096.dff	44	B	(Okay)
sw4096.dff	45	A	He didn't talk about cleaning it up or anything like that
sw4096.dff	45	A	So it's not very practical
sw4096.dff	46	B	No
sw4096.dff	46	B	it's interesting
sw4096.dff	46	B	I bet that was a good day at the conference then
sw4096.dff	47	A	(real) (interesting)
sw4096.dff	48	B	Did it change anything for you
sw4096.dff	49	A	not too much
sw4096.dff	49	A	(I) (got) (a) (bit)
sw4096.dff	49	A	(Actually)
sw4099.dff	1	A	(Kay)
sw4099.dff	2	B	(Okay)
sw4099.dff	3	A	(I) (guess) (we're) (talking) (about) (exercise)
sw4099.dff	4	B	first of all I have to ask you how old you are
sw4099.dff	5	A	I am twenty-seven
sw4099.dff	6	B	(Twenty-seven) (okay)
sw4099.dff	6	B	I am quite a bit older than you are
sw4099.dff	8	B	But no
sw4099.dff	8	B	I think exercise is extremely important and I do exercise on a regular basis
sw4099.dff	9	A	You do
sw4099.dff	9	A	What type of exercise do you do
sw4099.dff	10	B	I do jazzercise
sw4099.dff	11	A	(you) (do)
sw4099.dff	12	B	which is an aerobic program (that) are you familiar with it
sw4099.dff	13	A	Yes
sw4099.dff	14	B	It's a national company and we have a jazzercise center here in Plano that has classes all day long (so) (you) (can)
sw4099.dff	15	A	Are they different from aerobics or is it the same thing
sw4099.dff	16	B	No it's an aerobic routine
sw4099.dff	16	B	you warm up and then you have thirty minutes of aerobic activity starting slowly and then working up to a high heart rate and then you gradually go down again
sw4099.dff	17	A	And you do that every day (or)
sw4099.dff	18	B	No I only do it probably two or three times a week
sw4099.dff	19	A	(okay)
sw4099.dff	20	B	The minimum they want you to do is three times a week
sw4099.dff	21	A	And this is a club or do you belong to a group
sw4099.dff	22	B	(it's) (really) (a) it's called a center and you buy as many classes as you want to at a time and then you just go in whenever you can
sw4099.dff	22	B	So I usually choose to go at nine thirty in the morning or a nine fifteen class or a ten thirty class in the mornings
sw4099.dff	23	A	Do you go with friends or do you go alone
sw4099.dff	24	B	No I go by myself and that's one of the frustrating things cause I can find very few people to go with me
sw4099.dff	26	B	and most of my friends that are my age don't exercise or they might play tennis
sw4099.dff	28	B	and since I am not a tennis player I don't get that but I am in my late forties
sw4099.dff	30	B	so there aren't many people that want to do that
sw4099.dff	32	B	Most of the people that are in the classes are young mothers
sw4099.dff	32	B	(with) (children) (between) (the) (ages)
sw4099.dff	33	A	(young) (mothers) (or)
sw4099.dff	34	B	(Young) (mothers)
sw4099.dff	34	B	(young) (women)
sw4099.dff	36	B	with small children
sw4099.dff	38	B	(are) (the) (ones) (that) (I) (find)
sw4099.dff	38	B	what do you do
sw4099.dff	39	A	I really don't have a routine
sw4099.dff	39	A	I like playing basketball
sw4099.dff	39	A	We just bought a new home with a basketball hoop and
sw4099.dff	40	B	(great)
sw4099.dff	41	A	that's what I do every day
sw4099.dff	42	B	Do you play every day
sw4099.dff	43	A	pretty much
sw4099.dff	43	A	When my wife let's me
sw4099.dff	44	B	who do you play with
sw4099.dff	44	B	Do you have friends that play with you (or) (just)
sw4099.dff	45	A	No I just shoot around by myself
sw4099.dff	47	A	And that's about it
sw4099.dff	47	A	I use to play soccer a lot in high school but when I graduated I haven't done much
sw4099.dff	47	A	I don't have a problem
sw4099.dff	47	A	I know I have to do more aerobics but I don't have a problem with weight
sw4099.dff	47	A	I could eat all day and not gain an ounce
sw4099.dff	48	B	that's really good and I think that keeps some people from exercising
sw4099.dff	50	B	I don't have a problem with weight either but I think I don't have a problem because I exercise
sw4099.dff	51	A	You do exercise
sw4099.dff	52	B	people are always saying to me how do you stay thin and it's because I exercise
sw4099.dff	53	A	You do it
sw4099.dff	54	B	but I also watch what I eat
sw4099.dff	56	B	but you'll come being twenty-seven you don't really have to worry about your heart rate and that yet
sw4099.dff	57	A	(and) (I)
sw4099.dff	58	B	but as you get older you will
sw4099.dff	59	A	everyone's told me my waist line is going to expand one of these days but I don't know
sw4099.dff	60	B	it might not
sw4099.dff	62	B	Mine because everybody's been telling me that too and so far it hasn't happened and I just feel like you have to constantly weigh yourself
sw4099.dff	64	B	and just keep an eye on it and cut back if it starts to get too high
sw4099.dff	65	A	I guess I enjoy sports a lot so that's why I've kept active in that way
sw4099.dff	66	B	But you don't play any other sports but basketball
sw4099.dff	67	A	basketball volleyball too bad it's not really heavy as far as recreation or hobby I do that
sw4099.dff	68	B	But do you ski
sw4099.dff	68	B	Being in Utah I was wondering if you ski
sw4099.dff	69	A	I use to but it got too expensive (so)
sw4099.dff	70	B	(did) (it) (really)
sw4099.dff	72	B	Cause I know that skiing in Utah is suppose to be great
sw4099.dff	73	A	a lot of people do that
sw4099.dff	75	A	but I never find the time
sw4099.dff	75	A	I had rather do other things
sw4099.dff	76	B	I have never skied before but I have friends that go to Utah all the time (and) (they) (think) (it's) (really)
sw4099.dff	77	A	they come up here
sw4099.dff	78	B	and they ski
sw4099.dff	78	B	I guess there's a place where you can ski is it Tahoe
sw4099.dff	78	B	Where you ski from no that's Nevada to California
sw4099.dff	79	A	That's in Nevada
sw4099.dff	80	B	(I) (guess)
sw4099.dff	82	B	I am thinking about where you can ski over the state line
sw4099.dff	83	A	(but)
sw4099.dff	84	B	But there is a place in Utah called a funny name
sw4099.dff	85	A	There's Snow Bird or Alta
sw4099.dff	86	B	(But) (it's) (like) (Heavenly)
sw4099.dff	86	B	(Is) (that) (it)
sw4099.dff	87	A	Heavenly
sw4099.dff	88	B	I think it's called Heavenly
sw4099.dff	89	A	I've never heard of that one
sw4099.dff	90	B	(You've) (never) (heard) (of) (that)
sw4099.dff	92	B	maybe it isn't in Utah
sw4099.dff	94	B	But they said they've skied Heavenly and it sounded like that they skied really well when they are actually talking about a place
sw4099.dff	94	B	It's kind of funny
sw4099.dff	95	A	Do they exercise much I mean for skiing
sw4099.dff	95	A	I know when I went you can get sore easily (but)
sw4099.dff	96	B	You can get really sore
sw4099.dff	96	B	(I) (know) (you) I've talked to people but most of these people ski enough so that they don't get sore
sw4099.dff	97	A	is one or two timer a year if I do go on them and I am really sore after
sw4099.dff	98	B	And then is it your quadriceps that are the worst
sw4099.dff	100	B	In your legs (and)
sw4099.dff	101	A	My legs really (really) ache
sw4099.dff	103	A	But (that's) I am using muscles that I have never used before
sw4099.dff	104	B	and it's strange that you can do like I did aerobics all the time and then I went horseback riding and still I was so sore (and) (I) (couldn't) (get) (over)
sw4101.dff	2	B	Hey Steve
sw4101.dff	2	B	they just started a recycling program here I think
sw4101.dff	2	B	this is my first experience with recycling program but instead of just tossing everything away which I always felt bad about I am starting to split stuff up
sw4101.dff	2	B	The only disadvantage is that they don't pick it up at the curb
sw4101.dff	2	B	They make me drive it a mile down the road and spit it out down there
sw4101.dff	2	B	What are they doing up there
sw4101.dff	3	A	here in Saskatoon much the same thing
sw4101.dff	3	A	There is no curb pick up of any of the recycled products
sw4101.dff	3	A	we're in a community of about one hundred and eighty thousand people
sw4101.dff	3	A	(there) (are) (areas) (where) (we) (could) actually we have a couple of the handicapped societies types of places where the one they do as just a recycling operation and then others they collect the paper and ship it to other retailers so we are able to have drop off bins for news papers and cardboard and that kind of thing and then there's a deposit program on plastic and glass containers
sw4101.dff	3	A	primarily soft drink bottles and so we are able to take it to one of the rehabilitation centers and then they recycle the containers
sw4101.dff	3	A	They refund the deposit which is anywhere from five to fifteen cents a container (and) (then)
sw4101.dff	4	B	(the) (deposits) (only) (on) (drink) (stuff)
sw4101.dff	6	B	(Okay)
sw4101.dff	7	A	(primarily) (on) (soft) (drink) (pops) (and) (that) (kind) (of) (thing)
sw4101.dff	8	B	(Okay)
sw4101.dff	9	A	so they induce recycling of plastic and glass soft drink containers
sw4101.dff	9	A	we do have one of the scrape metal dealers that will accept tin and aluminum cans as well
sw4101.dff	10	B	(okay)
sw4101.dff	11	A	there is a deposit on aluminum pop cans and beer cans and so the recycler with the handicapped group will also accept those
sw4101.dff	11	A	So it's fairly extensive but then again it's the initiative of the individual person because there is no coordinated pick up by the city
sw4101.dff	12	B	(did) (they) are you giving these products to the handicapped group and the handicapped group is getting (the) the money or are some home distributing the funds back to you
sw4101.dff	13	A	there's the opportunity for both
sw4101.dff	14	B	(Okay)
sw4101.dff	15	A	(Generally) (the) (handicapped) (group) (takes) (care) (of) (the) (things) (that) actually the government has placed the deposit which is the inducement to recycle the bottle so that you get your money back and then the recycler run by the handicapped society pays back the cost of that deposit and then they in turn will get some money from the bottlers and from the the people that do the canning of the pop and the beer as well
sw4101.dff	16	B	That's very cool
sw4101.dff	16	B	I heard about a similar program in New York City (where) (a) (thing) (called) Homeless Incorporated (or) (something) (like) (that) (but) what they do is employ (I) (think) (mostly) (men) (but) homeless people to go out and collect all the recyclable cans (and) (I) (think) (it's) (mostly) (cans)
sw4101.dff	16	B	There may be bottles as well but beer cans soda cans (and) (what) (not) and they bring them up to one centralized location and are able to collect the money from the various beer and soda manufacturers and get more money to these people that desperately need it
sw4101.dff	17	A	I guess partly because of our climate
sw4101.dff	17	A	Here in Saskatoon (at) (least) the majority of (central) (I) (want) (to) (say) Central Canada (but) Central Canada tends to referred more to Ontario and Quebec
sw4101.dff	19	A	but we don't have much of a situation where we might call them homeless people
sw4101.dff	19	A	We certainly have a fair number of people that are on welfare and unemployment insurance (and) (that) (kind) (of) (thing)
sw4101.dff	19	A	there's psychological pressure against employing people to do that kind of thing although scouts and hockey teams and ball teams (those) (kinds) regularly do bottle drives where they go around in various neighborhoods and collect the bottles at individual homes
sw4101.dff	20	B	Do they do it with news papers as well
sw4101.dff	21	A	They have done it some but we have actually quite an extensive network of collecting news papers
sw4101.dff	21	A	They are actually at virtually all of the shopping centers
sw4101.dff	21	A	(the) (shopping) (malls)
sw4101.dff	21	A	There are several containers where the group called Cosmopolitan Industries collects or people can drop their used news papers and other papers in the bins and then the bins are collected
sw4104.dff	1	A	(Anyway) ()
sw4104.dff	2	B	(How) (about) (you)
sw4104.dff	2	B	What do you do with your budget
sw4104.dff	3	A	What do I do at the moment it's under chaos
sw4104.dff	3	A	(now) (I'm) (just) I don't really have a budget per se
sw4104.dff	3	A	it's called living within your means
sw4104.dff	5	A	which means at the moment paying off the VISA bill and keeping everything else under control and hoping the car doesn't collapse
sw4104.dff	6	B	(That's) (true)
sw4104.dff	7	A	but no I don't really have a budget at the moment
sw4104.dff	7	A	but I have a rough feel for how much money I can afford to spend each month and then I usually don't exceed that unless the VISA bill gets out of hand for one reason or another like if I have car expenses and then it goes through the moon (so)
sw4104.dff	8	B	that's sort of a problem
sw4104.dff	9	A	(what) (do) (yo-)
sw4104.dff	10	B	we're trying to so far we are in the clear credit wise but the other side of it is so not much on that side of it to add to it
sw4104.dff	10	B	We're trying to think of how to put away some savings and stuff like that (but)
sw4104.dff	11	A	So you can afford to get a house
sw4104.dff	12	B	we'd like to do that some day
sw4104.dff	14	B	We have this dream
sw4104.dff	16	B	But we don't know how long it will be a dream
sw4104.dff	18	B	we're real happy that we don't have any debt but at the same time we're real scared about incurring it in this economy now so
sw4104.dff	20	B	we're stepping real careful and trying to see what's the best way to save the little bit that we do get on top of expenses every month
sw4104.dff	21	A	what do you and your husband do
sw4104.dff	22	B	We're missionaries actually
sw4104.dff	23	A	(Are) (you) (really)
sw4104.dff	24	B	And it will be easier once we get overseas cause we have support quota
sw4104.dff	26	B	and it's cheaper to live overseas than it is to live here
sw4104.dff	27	A	(No) (kidding)
sw4104.dff	28	B	And it doesn't get switched very easily once you come home
sw4104.dff	29	A	(I) (see)
sw4104.dff	31	A	Overseas where would you be going
sw4104.dff	32	B	Africa Nigeria
sw4104.dff	33	A	Really
sw4104.dff	35	A	(Really)
sw4104.dff	35	A	How long would you be there
sw4104.dff	36	B	About four years
sw4104.dff	36	B	We're career so we go over seas for four years and then we come back for a year
sw4104.dff	36	B	We go over four we come back for a year
sw4104.dff	37	A	with what Church
sw4104.dff	38	B	we're with Wycliff Bible Translators
sw4104.dff	39	A	(yes)
sw4104.dff	39	A	Yes
sw4104.dff	41	A	I know who they are
sw4104.dff	41	A	they have an office in Costa Mesa as I recall
sw4104.dff	42	B	(they) (could) (very) (well) (and)
sw4104.dff	43	A	(you) (know) there was a fairly large building (well) that belongs to them
sw4104.dff	43	A	are you active in translation
sw4104.dff	44	B	we will be
sw4104.dff	44	B	I was over four years doing language surveying which is the first step
sw4104.dff	44	B	You're kind of like the scout that goes ahead of the team and assesses the need
sw4104.dff	46	B	And came home and got married and we will go back as translators cause we want to raise a family and it is easier to raise a family as translators
sw4104.dff	46	B	I always wanted to do translation but as long as I was single and foot loose so to speak it's easier
sw4104.dff	46	B	they really need surveyors cause you're free to travel anywhere
sw4104.dff	46	B	You don't have kids hanging around you and stuff
sw4104.dff	47	A	(True) (true) (enough)
sw4104.dff	47	A	what languages do you speak besides English of course
sw4104.dff	48	B	I have a smattering of about ten different ones but (there's) I'm not bilingual in any of them because I kept switching from one area (to) the other since I did
sw4104.dff	50	B	complete a survey in one area I'd switch to the other
sw4104.dff	50	B	So I know the greetings in about ten
sw4104.dff	52	B	and how to do market stuff but in about five I guess I can do better in it
sw4104.dff	52	B	And my French is pretty good but it's French so I'm terrified to speak (in)
sw4104.dff	53	A	(In) (France)
sw4104.dff	54	B	in France
sw4104.dff	54	B	because they're real snobby about their language and French is street French and I just picked it up off the street and I knew what I was (I) (knew) (what) (I) (was) communicating but I didn't know what I was saying
sw4104.dff	54	B	I never sat there and got a direct translation and said something here when I came home and French to somebody and he paled and said I'm not going to tell you what you said
sw4104.dff	54	B	So since then I have refrained from speaking any French
sw4104.dff	56	B	(In)
sw4104.dff	58	B	I don't know what I said to him but I didn't ask him either
sw4104.dff	59	A	(Must) (have) (been) (terrible)
sw4104.dff	59	A	(The) (was) (it) Henry Macon said that the language was like a man slowly bleeding to death
sw4104.dff	59	A	So they hemorrhaged him to death without new infusions that will eventually die and it just amazes me that the French don't recognize that
sw4104.dff	59	A	(Free) (style) (English) (is) (just) (takes) (on)
sw4109.dff	1	A	(guy) (some) (of) (my) (things) I'd like to have a short work week
sw4109.dff	2	B	(okay)
sw4109.dff	3	A	and we need better health insurance (and) (cau-)
sw4109.dff	4	B	(Okay) we can start off there
sw4109.dff	4	B	(Let's) (just) (get) (started)
sw4109.dff	5	A	(Okay)
sw4109.dff	6	B	If you don't want to talk about it now and then
sw4109.dff	7	A	(Okay)
sw4109.dff	8	B	be bored when we get to it
sw4109.dff	9	A	(Okay) I just press one then
sw4109.dff	11	A	(Okay) ready
sw4109.dff	13	A	(Okay)
sw4109.dff	14	B	I think that a short work week is real nice
sw4109.dff	14	B	I have a thirty-seven hour work week
sw4109.dff	14	B	How about you
sw4109.dff	15	A	now I'm just a student
sw4109.dff	15	A	I only work part time but I've work in the job force before
sw4109.dff	17	A	and forty hours is just too long
sw4109.dff	17	A	You just don't have any time to do anything
sw4109.dff	17	A	It seems like Saturday you get off but Sunday you're getting ready for Monday
sw4109.dff	17	A	(And) (if) (we) (get) (have) (a)
sw4109.dff	19	A	if we could have a thirty-two hour work week (with) (that) (happen) (is) (that) for every four people we could give another job
sw4109.dff	21	A	And then (that) (way) everybody would have a three day holiday And that would make a bigger market
sw4109.dff	21	A	We'd have more recreation
sw4109.dff	21	A	People would have time to do it
sw4109.dff	21	A	There would be less of a stress level
sw4109.dff	21	A	we'd have less crime
sw4109.dff	21	A	we'd have to build less prisons less police force
sw4109.dff	22	B	(it) (all) (makes) (sense) (to) (me)
sw4109.dff	22	B	Although there may be more crime
sw4109.dff	22	B	if people have more leisure time
sw4109.dff	22	B	It's not clear
sw4109.dff	22	B	(And) (that)
sw4109.dff	23	A	(that's) (a) (possibility)
sw4109.dff	25	A	one of the problems they're facing now (a) (lot) (of) (people) (now) is that the small business can't offer health insurance
sw4109.dff	27	A	and it's too costly and (what) (is) (happening) (is) (that) they're on a policy where they have X amount of users in it So they get a specific rate
sw4109.dff	27	A	(what) (happens) (is) (that) if people start having chronic illness (and) (things) (like) (that) what happened and (where) they really have to spend (out) a lot of money
sw4109.dff	29	A	(for) (one) (particular) it's called a group (well) (what) (happens) (then) (is) (that) (they) (cancel) because they just can't cancel an individual
sw4109.dff	29	A	(So) they have to cancel just life insurance
sw4109.dff	29	A	They have to cancel everything
sw4109.dff	31	A	(what) (they) (do) (is) (that) (they) (cancel) (the) (insurance) (and) (then) (all) (the) (people) (don't) (have) (any) (insurance) (coverage)
sw4109.dff	33	A	But I'm satisfied with my job
sw4109.dff	33	A	I'm an engineering student
sw4109.dff	35	A	And I work for my instructor and I'm not a typical student
sw4109.dff	35	A	I'm older
sw4109.dff	35	A	I'm in my thirties
sw4109.dff	37	A	(And) (so) I have a lot of job experience and my instructor thrives on that because he can just tell me what he wants and he can give me access (and) (tell) (me) (what) (to) (do) and just turn me loose
sw4109.dff	39	A	but in the same token it's really enjoyable for me because I don't have to have nobody breathing down my back (and)
sw4109.dff	41	A	and one of the things that I (I) really hate about jobs
sw4109.dff	41	A	(I) (don't) (I) (don't) like bosses that (that) want to yell at you and are down on your back (and) (all) (this) (and) (that)
sw4109.dff	41	A	I (I) just really can't deal with that
sw4109.dff	43	A	what kind of jobs have you done
sw4109.dff	44	B	I do research in computer science and I've just been doing that for a few years now
sw4109.dff	46	B	my job has most of the benefits I want
sw4109.dff	46	B	what I really like is (I) (like) (being) they send me to conferences for instance but probably not as much as I'd like but that's just nice (you) (know) having a company being able to give you time to do that sort of thing (and) (sort) (of) (they) (also) a really important thing to me is when they pay for continuing education
sw4109.dff	46	B	I get night courses that they'll cover now and that's really good
sw4109.dff	47	A	(that's) (just) (great)
sw4109.dff	47	A	You have what you might call knowledge power
sw4109.dff	49	A	when you work at a company whether you know it or not is that you're categorized
sw4109.dff	49	A	Some people can be let go and replaced like say a typist somebody who does data entry or answers the telephone or receptionist
sw4109.dff	49	A	But if you're a person that's doing computer type things and you have the knowledge you know what the system you've revised and revamped the system then you're vital to the company
sw4109.dff	51	A	and you get more benefits (That's) (where) (I'm) (like) I'm into computers too and that's one of the things that I've found in any one of these jobs and anything I've done is that to have knowledge
sw4109.dff	51	A	When you have the knowledge you're not going to be let go be one of the last ones to let go anyway
sw4113.dff	1	A	so do you think our politicians are honest at this point in time
sw4113.dff	2	B	Generally I don't think they are
sw4113.dff	2	B	my personal opinion is that the politicians are out for their own good because they're entrenched
sw4113.dff	4	B	They don't ever have to go out and get a real job
sw4113.dff	4	B	They just
sw4113.dff	6	B	stay in their current job (you) (know) (what) (I) (mean)
sw4113.dff	7	A	(I) (agree) (with) (both) (of) (those) (things) but do you see any way of like altering it so that they would become more honest
sw4113.dff	8	B	(I) (think) by putting term limitations on you could slow down some of the problems
sw4113.dff	10	B	but it has to be not just at the national level but at (you) (know) the state and the local level too
sw4113.dff	10	B	I know some senators and I don't know which ones but they've been in office since the nineteen forties
sw4113.dff	12	B	and (I) they've never had a job
sw4113.dff	12	B	they've never gone out in the real world and paid normal taxes
sw4113.dff	14	B	I know they pay taxes but they don't
sw4113.dff	16	B	they get paid a hundred and twenty-five grand a year
sw4113.dff	18	B	Which is more than twice my salary by quite a bit and I'm going like I don't understand how they're supposed to be my servants and yet they're paid more than I am
sw4113.dff	20	B	and they work you know less than I do
sw4113.dff	23	A	the only problem I see with term limitations is that I think that the bureaucracy in our government as is with most governments is just so complex that you know there is a learning curve and that you can't just send someone off to Washington and expect his first day to be an effective Congress person
sw4113.dff	23	A	I think there's a lot they need to learn when you get there
sw4113.dff	33	A	the other thing that bothers me about our system is just that in Congress the amount of power any particular Congress critter has is based on their seniority (and) (how) (long) (they've) (been) (there) (so) (it's) (for) so unless you have actual across the board limitations (you) (know) the idea of (we're) I'm just going to vote against the incumbent every time doesn't work it's going to wind up hurting your state if all the other states aren't doing it at the same time
sw4113.dff	34	B	I think that that's true but then you have the same abuse of power on the flip side of that coin
sw4113.dff	36	B	the C I A is moving out to West Virginia which is a really stupid location for a large agency like that and for almost any agency
sw4113.dff	36	B	the action isn't in West Virginia
sw4113.dff	36	B	I hate to tell the senator from West Virginia this information but
sw4113.dff	38	B	(it) (really) (doesn't) the world does not revolve around West Virginia
sw4113.dff	40	B	(as) (far) (as) (this) (country) (is) (concerned) the world does revolve around D C
sw4113.dff	42	B	as far as the politics in this country are concerned the national politics (and) the C I A is a very large very high profile agency and to have it located out in West Virginia it might only be two hour drive from here but (that's) (a) (two) (hour) (drive)
sw4113.dff	44	B	(and) I think it's a mistake to move large agencies like that
sw4113.dff	46	B	(or) (is) (it) (the) (F) (B) (I)
sw4113.dff	46	B	(I) (don't) (remember) (but) (I) (think) (there's)
sw4113.dff	47	A	(l-) (t-) I don't see why it makes a big difference the C I A because officially they don't have any operations within the United States other than administrative
sw4113.dff	48	B	(that's) (officially)
sw4113.dff	50	B	we all know that that's not necessarily true
sw4113.dff	50	B	But I think that there are advantages to having seniority or not having a complete turnover every some small number of years
sw4113.dff	50	B	I think I mean there's an institutional memory that you need to maintain
sw4113.dff	52	B	But I think that with all the perks that we've given them I heard on the radio back a few weeks ago during the incidents where (you) (know) (like) they aren't paying their restaurant bills and
sw4113.dff	54	B	they're bouncing checks all over the place
sw4113.dff	56	B	one of the radio stations over here listed off every single one of the perks
sw4114.dff	1	A	how you like New Jersey
sw4114.dff	2	B	it's pretty good You get closer to the coast here and you (do) get a good bit of smog (and) (stuff) especially from all the fuel cracking towers and chemical plants
sw4114.dff	3	A	I don't know what part of New Jersey you're in but I guess it's fairly industrial
sw4114.dff	4	B	it's when you get further east towards New York City it gets very industrial
sw4114.dff	6	B	but I'm about thirty miles west of there so you have (actually) (green) trees and such that you
sw4114.dff	8	B	don't notice that other part of
sw4114.dff	10	B	New Jersey exists
sw4114.dff	12	B	Actually (very)
sw4114.dff	14	B	(you) (know) you go even a few miles out and you got farms and (everything) (so) (you) relatively clear air
sw4114.dff	16	B	(But)
sw4114.dff	17	A	(I) (don't) (know) (about) (you) (but) I've always considered automobiles to be (probably) the prime contributor
sw4114.dff	17	A	there's a lot of contributors but (it) (seems) (that) automobiles would probably do more than their fair share of that
sw4114.dff	18	B	definitely
sw4114.dff	18	B	(It's)
sw4114.dff	20	B	there are a large number of them on the road
sw4114.dff	20	B	They're all going and a lot of them are in relatively poor repair
sw4114.dff	21	A	that's a big issue is a lot of states don't have a inspection law so you get a lot of people out there without E T R emission control systems on their cars and things like that
sw4114.dff	22	B	even where you do have the inspections the inspection is once a year
sw4114.dff	23	A	(and) (it's) (like)
sw4114.dff	24	B	You get the car that's in the accident and muffler falls off or something
sw4114.dff	25	A	(Sure)
sw4114.dff	26	B	and guy keeps driving along for long period of time after that
sw4114.dff	27	A	I guess from what I hear though next year Ford is coming out with their electric cars
sw4114.dff	27	A	They're actually coming out with the first prototypes in California
sw4114.dff	28	B	that and I think also some of the car companies are coming out with gas powered fleets
sw4114.dff	30	B	so you natural gas powered rather than gasoline
sw4114.dff	31	A	I'm hoping that comes along quick
sw4114.dff	31	A	I was reading an article in TIME the other day about the ozone layer and how fast that's going and I guess it's really disappearing a lot quicker than people realize and I know it's not due to gasoline or to carbon monoxide so much as the C F C -s (but)
sw4114.dff	32	B	it is coming from cars though
sw4114.dff	33	A	I think that's a contributor definitely
sw4114.dff	34	B	the car air conditioners is
sw4114.dff	36	B	one of the major leaking sources of the freon
sw4114.dff	38	B	Which is one of the major fluorocarbons
sw4114.dff	39	A	I guess now what they're primarily worried about is third world countries because (I) (guess) United States and Russia have kind of taken the lead in terms of eliminating C F C production (but)
sw4114.dff	40	B	(it)
sw4114.dff	41	A	(it) (go) (ahead)
sw4114.dff	42	B	No it's the type of thing there that the Third World countries are less industrial and they want to become industrial
sw4114.dff	44	B	so they're on the different part of the cycle of the U S
sw4114.dff	44	B	The U S used all the air pollution stuff and air polluting technologies to get where it is today
sw4114.dff	45	A	And that's one of the arguments that the Third World countries have been using is that basically they don't want to have to pay for our mistakes if that makes any sense
sw4114.dff	45	A	in (terms) (of)
sw4114.dff	46	B	or they want the to make the same mistakes themselves to bootstrap them up to where we
sw4114.dff	47	A	(Exactly)
sw4114.dff	48	B	got to
sw4114.dff	49	A	Exactly
sw4114.dff	49	A	those are joining arguments but (I) (don't) (know) that's kind of an interesting situation there
sw4114.dff	49	A	those third world countries what they don't realize is how quickly the ozone is depleting
sw4114.dff	49	A	I guess the latest figures are up to fifty percent at the Poles and it's increasing even as near the Equator as Florida and Cuba and those places
sw4114.dff	51	A	(So) (it's) (kind) (of) (an) (interesting) (situation)
sw4114.dff	51	A	It's not a real good one actually
sw4114.dff	52	B	(No)
sw4114.dff	53	A	(But)
sw4114.dff	54	B	you also have the very close related thing of the rain forest destruction
sw4114.dff	56	B	which is the main source of what's clearing out the atmosphere and
sw4114.dff	58	B	replacing some of the pollutants
sw4114.dff	59	A	you don't get that source of cleansing anymore
sw4114.dff	59	A	have you been in big cities a long time
sw4114.dff	60	B	I've mostly been in the east coast so that's going between Atlanta D C area
sw4114.dff	61	A	Okay (so) (you've) (got)
sw4114.dff	62	B	(A-)
sw4114.dff	63	A	those are actually areas that are hit pretty hard I would think
sw4114.dff	64	B	not as hard as some places out west because you don't get the major pollution sources as you do out in Denver with the
sw4114.dff	65	A	(Denver's) (definitely)
sw4114.dff	66	B	inversion
sw4114.dff	67	A	that's one of the worst
sw4114.dff	68	B	and Los Angeles and rest of California which is just terrible it sounds
sw4114.dff	69	A	(Sure)
sw4114.dff	69	A	Denver's that real good example of sitting in a valley kind of like Mexico City does I guess
sw4114.dff	71	A	Mexico City is historically been one of the worst
sw4114.dff	73	A	in the world for that
sw4114.dff	73	A	But I've been pretty lucky I've lived in cities that really haven't had that much of a problem although I'm really kind of based in Orlando Florida and there you can tell that it's getting worse
sw4114.dff	73	A	definitely it's not at a level comparable to Los Angeles or Denver (but) (you) (can)
sw4114.dff	74	B	(there) it's almost all automobiles because there's not that much (in) (the) (way) (of)
sw4114.dff	75	A	(Exactly)
sw4114.dff	76	B	heavy industry that would be causing it
sw4114.dff	77	A	And there's not that much in terms of public transportation down there
sw4114.dff	79	A	There is (but) (it's)
sw4123.dff	1	A	Jimmy how do you get most of your news
sw4123.dff	2	B	I watch the national news every day for one
sw4123.dff	2	B	I also read one or two papers a day and I'm pretty much a news junkie and I tune in to C N N a lot
sw4123.dff	3	A	(wow)
sw4123.dff	3	A	when you say the morning news or evening news or national news is when
sw4123.dff	4	B	every evening at six thirty (I) (believe) I watch the national news
sw4123.dff	5	A	(okay)
sw4123.dff	5	A	I would probably be a junkie or watch C N N a lot but I don't subscribe to cable
sw4123.dff	7	A	because of the poor service and also because I give to the United Way and so I figured that amount of money I just donate to that
sw4123.dff	8	B	as opposed to paying for cable
sw4123.dff	9	A	(I) (take) (away) (a) (addiction)
sw4123.dff	11	A	(something)
sw4123.dff	13	A	(I)
sw4123.dff	14	B	overall (I) the quality of the news you get off of most sources I would say is pretty low
sw4123.dff	14	B	(It's) usually you get pretty incomplete coverage and that's one of the reasons why I try and get as many sources as possible because if you hear the same story from three different sources then you get a much clearer picture of what is going on
sw4123.dff	14	B	You would hope (but) (still) (hard) (to) (say)
sw4123.dff	16	B	(that) (what) (you've) (heard) (is) (what) (really) (is)
sw4123.dff	17	A	what newspapers do you read
sw4123.dff	18	B	(I) (read) the local newspaper and I also try and read one of the major dailies like the CHICAGO TRIBUNE or the NEW YORK TIMES (or) (something) (like) (that)
sw4123.dff	19	A	For a while (there) I subscribed to NEW YORK TIMES actually a couple of newspapers because my fiance (she) was unemployed (for) (a) (while) (so) (she) really needed to look at the help wanted ads
sw4123.dff	21	A	(and) (so) often the newspapers are trying to compete with (a) (lot) (of) other sources of news
sw4123.dff	23	A	(And) (I) (don't) (know) NEW YORK TIMES is okay (and) when you read a lot of this stuff the quality of the writing has definitely gone (down) in the last ten years or so (but)
sw4123.dff	25	A	they say it's like the sixth grade reading level (but)
sw4123.dff	27	A	I swear it's at least second or third grade
sw4123.dff	29	A	(sometimes)
sw4123.dff	30	B	(Pretty) (low)
sw4123.dff	31	A	(But) (I) (don't) (know) (I) (think) if you listen to N P R or something like
sw4123.dff	32	B	I (really) like N P R a lot
sw4123.dff	33	A	(That's) (pretty) (good)
sw4123.dff	33	A	(and) I like listening to that (on) (when) (I) (get) (a) (chance) when I'm in the car (a) long enough (time) to listen to it (because) (I)
sw4123.dff	34	B	(I) (N) (P) (R) (a) (lot) (also)
sw4123.dff	34	B	I (really) like them because (they) (give) instead of being as your newspaper or (your) T V news where you get a five minute blurb or a ten paragraph blurb they go really in depth on topics which (I) (think) is good
sw4123.dff	36	B	(And) (they) (also) their editorial stand point seems to be (a) (lot) better than (say) your major network news (and) (that) (kind) (of) (thing)
sw4123.dff	37	A	McNeil and Lehrer I guess (he's) (leaving) one of them is leaving
sw4123.dff	39	A	they're pretty good too
sw4123.dff	39	A	(I) (guess) a year ago you're probably watching C N N a lot
sw4123.dff	41	A	Had that invasion (or) (whatever) (it) (is)
sw4123.dff	42	B	(Sure) (was)
sw4123.dff	43	A	but (I) (don't) (know) I guess it's still a lot of hype
sw4123.dff	43	A	Look at the Smith trial
sw4123.dff	45	A	that was a joke
sw4123.dff	46	B	(that) (was) but then you also have things where they broadcast the Clarence Thomas hearings basically the whole length of them which I thought was really good
sw4123.dff	47	A	(the) (N) (P) (R) (doing) (that) I know I had some visitor and he was just (I) (don't) (know) fixated on that just listened to it
sw4123.dff	49	A	constantly
sw4123.dff	49	A	and I guess that's good when it's live if you'll really want that but that's not really providing you news
sw4123.dff	51	A	it's more like a media event (rather) (than)
sw4123.dff	52	B	(but) (the)
sw4123.dff	53	A	reporting
sw4123.dff	54	B	but the news (news) that you would get from any other source is being generated from that event which is something that's good also about C Span which I (I) tune into every once in a while
sw4123.dff	55	A	(really)
sw4123.dff	55	A	That's kind of boring to me I think
sw4123.dff	56	B	it is really kind of boring but that's if you don't watch it there then you're going to hear somebody else's canned report somebody else's view about it and (that's) (what) (you're) (supposed) (to) if you watch the news your opinion is going to be formed on what somebody else thought about it
sw4123.dff	58	B	as opposed to actually watching it yourself and forming your own opinion which I would be much more in favor of forming my own opinion as opposed to following someone else's
sw4123.dff	59	A	(I) (guess) (that's) (true)
sw4123.dff	59	A	But one of the ways that I get information is every day when I log in on the computer I subscribe to this thing it's free inside the company it's called INTELLECT and they basically type out abstracts (which) (are) (really) (literally) I've actually read the actual articles (they're) (pretty) (g-)
sw4127.dff	16	B	so they come in I pay them and (that's) (it) that's about
sw4127.dff	17	A	(that)
sw4127.dff	18	B	the extent of it I don't really have this major budget or anything
sw4127.dff	18	B	I'm real thrifty
sw4127.dff	18	B	I take care of two children and me and
sw4127.dff	20	B	just real careful with the money What little we have that's what I do
sw4127.dff	21	A	Yes it's pretty straightforward
sw4127.dff	21	A	(It's) (almo-) I can't imagine having to go into real complicated stuff and making
sw4127.dff	22	B	(No)
sw4127.dff	23	A	fancy budgets
sw4127.dff	23	A	It seems like if you're getting to that level you're not in real good control
sw4127.dff	24	B	I've never liked credit cards
sw4127.dff	26	B	and a lot of debt you
sw4127.dff	28	B	buy something on credit and you pay twice as much for it when you get done
sw4127.dff	31	A	I like using credit cards for everything but just paying off the bills
sw4127.dff	33	A	because that way it's a record of everything and I don't have to worry about keeping records of anything else
sw4127.dff	34	B	(I) (don't) (have)
sw4127.dff	35	A	because they come in at
sw4127.dff	36	B	(too) (many)
sw4127.dff	37	A	the end of the month
sw4127.dff	38	B	I don't have too many weaknesses but I found out a credit card was one of them
sw4127.dff	40	B	it's so much easier if something's on sale if you're a woman and you're a sale person
sw4127.dff	42	B	it's like it's on sale let's go grab it and if you don't have the money then use a credit card so I got rid of them credit cards
sw4127.dff	43	A	I guess if that's
sw4127.dff	45	A	if that's a weakness that's a good thing to do
sw4127.dff	46	B	(that) (was) (my) (weakness)
sw4127.dff	46	B	It wasn't bad I didn't have thousands of dollars and like that I just
sw4127.dff	48	B	learned that that wasn't for me
sw4127.dff	49	A	(Sure)
sw4127.dff	50	B	(but) (I) (self-employed) I have my own little cleaning business (type) (thing) (so) (I) (keep)
sw4127.dff	51	A	Do you find trouble keeping the records for taxes (and) (all) (that) (or)
sw4127.dff	52	B	No it's not hard I just keep it in a notebook and write down what I've made and what it's going to have to go for that month (and)
sw4127.dff	54	B	(it's) (not) (that) (hard)
sw4127.dff	54	B	(Not) (at) (all)
sw4127.dff	55	A	that's good to know
sw4127.dff	56	B	I always do my own income tax
sw4127.dff	58	B	Do you
sw4127.dff	59	A	I don't understand the idea of paying somebody to do it
sw4127.dff	61	A	It seems like it's absurd the number of people who end up having to pay somebody to do it
sw4127.dff	62	B	(R-) all you got to do is (read) (a) (book)
sw4127.dff	63	A	(I)
sw4127.dff	64	B	read the little book they send you
sw4127.dff	65	A	just the form
sw4127.dff	66	B	fill in the blanks
sw4127.dff	68	B	and go
sw4127.dff	68	B	it seems absurd that people will pay some bucks just to get
sw4127.dff	69	A	(and) (a) (lot) (of) (them)
sw4127.dff	70	B	someone to (it's) (dumb)
sw4127.dff	70	B	I guess if you had some really complicated stuff but I don't so I don't mess with it
sw4127.dff	72	B	But I don't use a calculator either ()
sw4127.dff	73	A	(I)
sw4127.dff	74	B	I don't have that many things to add up (so)
sw4127.dff	75	A	I don't trust myself with using a calculator or computer (y-) (too) (much) (stuff) (like) (that) because I want to make sure (that) that I keep on top of the numbers and understand what's going on
sw4127.dff	75	A	I know too many people who use a calculator if they make a mistake they find out two months later because they weren't paying attention
sw4127.dff	77	A	(And)
sw4127.dff	78	B	(And) (we) (have) (a)
sw4127.dff	79	A	(And) (it) (seem)
sw4127.dff	80	B	I bank at N C N B here and they have a number that you can call in and I always call in like once every other week or so and I will check off what checks have cleared (and)
sw4129.dff	1	A	Okay what are your views on capital punishment
sw4129.dff	2	B	I have ambivalent feelings because I don't think it serves as a kind of deterrent we would like to think it is
sw4129.dff	2	B	But on the other hand it is very expensive to maintain Texas has one of the biggest criminal justice systems in the country
sw4129.dff	3	A	(Yes)
sw4129.dff	4	B	And it's eating us alive budget wise (and)
sw4129.dff	5	A	are they currently practicing capital punishment
sw4129.dff	6	B	Yes we
sw4129.dff	7	A	in your state
sw4129.dff	8	B	do practice capital punishment but the nature of the courts and the appeals and the stays (and) (all) (that) means that it's a (very) long haul before anybody's ever executed
sw4129.dff	9	A	(Yes) that's similar to Georgia
sw4129.dff	10	B	And then I was reading in the paper just this morning (it's) (interesting) (because) (I) (had) (forgotten) (I) (guess) (that) (I) (wrote) (this) (little) (topic) (down) that it costs more to execute somebody than it does to keep them
sw4129.dff	11	A	(That's) (probably) (true) (considering)
sw4129.dff	12	B	Because of all the costs of the appeals and all that
sw4129.dff	13	A	(Yes)
sw4129.dff	15	A	(Yes) (I) (guess) in a way that (it) (kind) (of) defeats the purpose of having capital punishment (if)
sw4129.dff	16	B	I think capital punishment is supposed to be primarily a deterrent to other people
sw4129.dff	17	A	(Yes)
sw4129.dff	18	B	who would see it
sw4129.dff	19	A	that would be the intent of it
sw4129.dff	20	B	but I'm not sure how successful that is
sw4129.dff	21	A	I think it would be more successful if it was applied in a more expedient manner (if) (there) (weren't) (so) (many)
sw4129.dff	22	B	(Quicker)
sw4129.dff	23	A	(appeals)
sw4129.dff	24	B	(maybe)
sw4129.dff	25	A	(if) (the) (person) (who's) (going) (to) (commit) (the) (crime)
sw4129.dff	27	A	(knew) (that) (they) (were) (going) (to) (be) (punished) (severely) (possibly) (capital) (punishment)
sw4129.dff	28	B	what kind of work do you do
sw4129.dff	29	A	I'm a research engineer I work with Georgia Tech
sw4129.dff	30	B	I'm a school principal
sw4129.dff	32	B	Elementary school
sw4129.dff	50	B	Five hundred of them are good solid kids and I have the same thirty-seven in my office every day
sw4129.dff	52	B	And a lot of their parents are totally irresponsible
sw4129.dff	52	B	Some of them in the penal system
sw4129.dff	53	A	(So) (that's) (a) (difficult) (situation)
sw4129.dff	54	B	And you just see those kids going down the road
sw4129.dff	54	B	not all of them will commit offenses that have to do with capital punishment but some of them have already been in youth centers
sw4129.dff	56	B	(And) (that) (kind) (of) (thing) and if we had something to do before they get to be full-blown adult criminals and I'm not talking about necessarily in the school system I'm not sure that the school system should be the agent of all the social action
sw4129.dff	58	B	I think that's one reason we have problems in schools and some of them are our problems but a lot of it's because everything society wants we are supposed to do
sw4129.dff	60	B	(But) (that's) (another) (subject) (but)
sw4129.dff	61	A	(that's) (probably) (true)
sw4129.dff	61	A	(W-)
sw4129.dff	62	B	I dealt with two or three kids today that are going to end up where somebody making a decision what to do with them
sw4129.dff	63	A	(I) (guess) that's not an easy solution
sw4129.dff	63	A	(there's) (no) (easy)
sw4129.dff	65	A	(solution) (for) (that)
sw4129.dff	66	B	(I) (don't) (know) (that) (there) (is) (an) (easy) (solution) but if you could find a way to prevent some of it and I'm not sure what it would be
sw4129.dff	68	B	It would be money better spent than do you know it costs more to keep an inmate on death row than it does to send a kid to Harvard
sw4129.dff	70	B	(That's) (true)
sw4129.dff	71	A	(I'm) (sure) (it) (is)
sw4129.dff	72	B	(Statistically) (that's) (true)
sw4129.dff	73	A	(I) (don't) certainly capital punishment isn't
sw4129.dff	75	A	going to solve a lot of problems (but)
sw4129.dff	76	B	Are you for it
sw4129.dff	78	B	I'm for it (in)
sw4129.dff	79	A	I guess I am
sw4129.dff	80	B	in some cases
sw4129.dff	81	A	(for) (certain) (cri-)
sw4129.dff	83	A	in certain crimes
sw4129.dff	84	B	What kind of crimes would you use it for
sw4129.dff	85	A	premeditated murder
sw4129.dff	87	A	Crimes of that nature (I) (think) (should) (definitely) any mass murderer type individual
sw4129.dff	88	B	I would consider it for sexual abuse of children on going
sw4129.dff	90	B	not one instance but perpetual abusers of children
sw4129.dff	91	A	you always have castration
sw4129.dff	92	B	somebody elected that recently
sw4129.dff	93	A	(Yes) I read about that
sw4129.dff	94	B	And all the civil rights people are up in arms about it
sw4129.dff	96	B	(But)
sw4130.dff	12	B	but that's why they should have started doing stuff before
sw4130.dff	12	B	still since it's dormant for such a long time there's still probably a lot of people before the tests ever really came out
sw4130.dff	14	B	who are draining a lot of money now
sw4130.dff	15	A	I think a lot of it was just that because the majority of the high risk groups were people
sw4130.dff	17	A	no one really cared about
sw4130.dff	19	A	(That)
sw4130.dff	20	B	(and) all these God-fearing people were like
sw4130.dff	22	B	God is trying to kill off all the et cetera (et) (cetera)
sw4130.dff	23	A	one humorous retort I heard someone who claimed that AIDS was God's punishment
sw4130.dff	25	A	was that then lesbians must be God's chosen people
sw4130.dff	27	A	But
sw4130.dff	28	B	Boy that's a good one
sw4130.dff	32	B	(Yes)
sw4130.dff	33	A	do you actually think we're doing enough now (to)
sw4130.dff	34	B	No I really don't
sw4130.dff	34	B	I did (a) research (kind) (of) (thing) on AIDS research (and) (stuff) and really we're not doing much at all I mean it's not really federal movement most of what gets raised (by)
sw4130.dff	35	A	Private organizations
sw4130.dff	36	B	conscious communities (and) (things) (like) (that)
sw4130.dff	38	B	San Francisco has a real strong AIDS support group (and) (all) (that) (kind) (of) (stuff) and
sw4130.dff	40	B	and get (they) (get) donations from the community (they're) (real)
sw4130.dff	42	B	And from corporations around the city for AIDS research (and) (that) (kind) (of) thing and I think there needs to be more of that (sort) (of) on a federal level rather than just in the places (you) (know) where it's predominated so far because you know it's
sw4130.dff	44	B	bound to spread
sw4130.dff	45	A	(it) (seems) (that) it's just going to reach a steady state a lot lot higher point than it will if (you) (know) we'd nip it in the bud (to) (quote) (Barney) (Fife)
sw4130.dff	46	B	I don't know (I) (don't) (know) (I) (don't) (know) what the likelihood of that is but people really waking up
sw4130.dff	48	B	Especially with the ultra conservatives
sw4130.dff	50	B	move our political system (sort) (of) seems to be taking
sw4130.dff	51	A	(I) (would) (probably) (agree) (with) (that)
sw4130.dff	52	B	(so)
sw4130.dff	53	A	so do you think it's more important to spend money on research or for support of people
sw4130.dff	54	B	(God) (that's) (a) (good) (question) (Fish)
sw4130.dff	54	B	(I) (don't) (know) I think one of the main things that's really important to spend money on is education not support or research per se but education because a lot of people sort of get drummed out of the work place and out of society kind of like lepers would
sw4130.dff	58	B	and it's really not necessary until the disease reaches its final stage becomes really infectious
sw4130.dff	60	B	and I think that would be the most effective support they could get is for other people (you) (know) try to understand what they're going through (and) (everything) and try to understand that
sw4130.dff	62	B	they don't have to be just completely cut off from the community
sw4130.dff	64	B	and (I) (don't) (know) (I) (guess) (I) (think) that research is (I) (guess) the most important just because (you) (know) it really needs to come to an end
sw4130.dff	66	B	(I) (don't) (know)
sw4130.dff	66	B	(I) (don't) (know) (Fish)
sw4130.dff	66	B	What do you think about that subject
sw4130.dff	67	A	I think it stands a really interesting question (of)
sw4133.dff	9	A	never going to get caught
sw4133.dff	10	B	but you also have to think whether it's worthwhile on the individual basis for example someone like Jeffrey Dahlmer (do) (you) (want) by putting him in prison for life there is still a possibility that he will get out again
sw4133.dff	11	A	one
sw4133.dff	12	B	Whereas
sw4133.dff	13	A	way or another
sw4133.dff	14	B	if you kill him there is not that possibility
sw4133.dff	15	A	but the other side to that is if you put him in prison for life there's a chance that he might do things in prison you know and somehow redeem himself
sw4133.dff	16	B	I don't think he could ever redeem himself but
sw4133.dff	18	B	in some cases yes
sw4133.dff	19	A	so that (you) (know) the other problem with capital punishment you run into is what are you going to do about people who are later to have been found innocent There are cases where twenty thirty years after the fact of getting evidence especially as new technology comes along that might prove their innocence then oops I'm sorry guess we killed the wrong guy
sw4133.dff	20	B	(it's) once you've made a decision that way it's a little difficult to go back on it
sw4133.dff	21	A	you can apologize nicely but I think the price I've heard quotes it's better that a thousand people go free than one person be unjustly imprisoned
sw4133.dff	21	A	I think is really the philosophy of the way our legal system works
sw4133.dff	22	B	(it's) (a-) the benefit of the doubt to the last iota is based on the person who is accused
sw4133.dff	23	A	(and) (I) (think) (that) and the way it's being used now (it's) (like) you listen to Bush (you) (know) (where) (are) (we) (going) (to) (impose) (d-) (it's) (like) for drug dealers is the new big thing in Tsongas is also saying make it a capital crime to be a major drug dealer
sw4133.dff	25	A	And again I don't thing these people care
sw4133.dff	25	A	They risk their lives every day
sw4133.dff	26	B	and they seem that the profit margin's so high that
sw4133.dff	28	B	the risk is almost not there
sw4133.dff	29	A	(and) (especially) (now) I live in Massachusetts we're going to get capital punishment here probably after the second coming or something
sw4133.dff	31	A	but you look at our crime rates (and) (things) (like) (that) and you compare them to Texas or someplace that does it's impossible to make a case that it's affecting it in any way
sw4133.dff	33	A	I think it's mainly people they get the vengeance of it
sw4133.dff	35	A	(Because)
sw4133.dff	36	B	(it's) (also) I used to live in Georgia and the big thing down there was (all) we have capital punishment but if you look at who gets accused and who are the ones who actually get executed it's very racially (related)
sw4133.dff	38	B	and ethnically related
sw4133.dff	39	A	it's lot of blacks
sw4133.dff	39	A	Also a lot of young people
sw4133.dff	39	A	a sixty-two year old guy is less likely to be put on death row from what I've seen
sw4133.dff	41	A	And I think when you listen to the victims' families (and) (things) they're always talking about feeling justified or (feeling) like they've gotten something out of it my thought has been once the guy has been imprisoned if he goes to jail forever or whatever if he gets killed it shouldn't make any difference to the victim's family
sw4133.dff	41	A	(The) (only) (thing) (that) (should) (really) obviously if someone of mine who has close died I'd probably feel differently but
sw4133.dff	43	A	the important thing is that they be caught and not be a danger to society
sw4133.dff	44	B	(and) (that) (and) also by keeping them in prison you do have the possibility though we don't currently do this of making restitution
sw4133.dff	45	A	(the)
sw4133.dff	46	B	you will work your prison job and any money you earn will go to the victim's family
sw4133.dff	47	A	(and) (the) (other) (thing) (is) (that) I was reading through a book on human geneo research
sw4133.dff	49	A	and there more and more things like schizophrenia and why does it just turn out to be genetic or biochemical in origin
sw4133.dff	51	A	So if someday we can go to Jeff Dahlmer and say the problem is you've got an endorphin imbalance and if you take this regularly you'll be a sane and productive member of society
sw4133.dff	53	A	you really get back to the question of is someone responsible for their actions
sw4133.dff	54	B	I think on some of it you have to say someone's responsible for his actions
sw4133.dff	54	B	(I) (never) (like) (the)
sw4133.dff	55	A	Society made me do it
sw4133.dff	56	B	(the) (defense)
sw4133.dff	58	B	I never liked the insanity defense
sw4137.dff	1	A	(Let's) (see) mine's pretty easy actually
sw4137.dff	1	A	I just got done reading (or) a couple magazine articles about the new Saturns
sw4137.dff	3	A	and although I can't afford it now I would just love to have one
sw4137.dff	4	B	(really) (you) (like) so you're an American
sw4137.dff	6	B	you want to buy American
sw4137.dff	7	A	No regardless of that fact
sw4137.dff	7	A	It's the best car in the class for the cheapest amount of money
sw4137.dff	7	A	I'm interested in having it for doing a little autocross racing closed circuit racing
sw4137.dff	9	A	(and) (it) (seems) (to) (just) (blow) (the) (competition) (away)
sw4137.dff	10	B	It terms of handling acceleration
sw4137.dff	11	A	Handling power everything
sw4137.dff	11	A	it just got the top rating
sw4137.dff	11	A	It was compared up against (let's) (see) there was the Mazda M X three Nissan's (whatever) their N X two thousand the Civic S I and it dominated over all of them
sw4137.dff	11	A	all the raters loved it
sw4137.dff	11	A	I like the styling and I seen a few of them actually race and they seem to be really good cars for it
sw4137.dff	12	B	What about Mustang G T -s
sw4137.dff	13	A	(Mustang) (G) (T) (-s)
sw4137.dff	13	A	can't afford it
sw4137.dff	14	B	(Those) so you're talking about ones in a lower end price range
sw4137.dff	15	A	I'm a graduate student and let's face it I don't make any money (so)
sw4137.dff	18	B	you can wait till you graduate and you'll have plenty of money you can buy whatever you want
sw4137.dff	21	A	we'll see then
sw4137.dff	21	A	now I'm stuck I've got a Pontiac Sunbird Turbo (that) it's fast but unreliable and trying to get it prepared for racing
sw4137.dff	21	A	But it would be nice just scrap it and go for the Saturn
sw4137.dff	22	B	would you use that for city driving and racing
sw4137.dff	23	A	I'd use it for both
sw4137.dff	23	A	The nice thing about autocrossing is you can do both
sw4137.dff	24	B	(Autocrossing) (is) what kind of track is that
sw4137.dff	25	A	just like a set up a lot of times and (it's) (like) really large parking lots
sw4137.dff	26	B	(Okay)
sw4137.dff	26	B	(And) (you) (set) (up) (the)
sw4137.dff	27	A	And pylons
sw4137.dff	28	B	(track) (pylons)
sw4137.dff	29	A	(and) (things)
sw4137.dff	30	B	(Okay)
sw4137.dff	31	A	Tight turns hard acceleration
sw4137.dff	31	A	I've seen a lot of Mustangs compete and it's interesting
sw4137.dff	31	A	They get dominated by the Corvettes that are also in their class
sw4137.dff	32	B	(really)
sw4137.dff	34	B	(I) (would) (guess) (so)
sw4137.dff	35	A	what are you thinking about buying
sw4137.dff	36	B	I think I'd like to get B M W if I go the German route which I'm kind of leaning towards now or maybe (I) (mean) a Acura Legend
sw4137.dff	37	A	(The) (Legend)
sw4137.dff	40	B	a Lexus S C three hundred maybe
sw4137.dff	42	B	Something on that order
sw4137.dff	42	B	I haven't really determined if I like the Japanese (or) (if) (I) (like) (them) enough to purchase one
sw4137.dff	46	B	because your B M W -s your German cars have good reputations I think
sw4137.dff	47	A	(I) (was) (actually) (in) a lot of the B M W -s are produced in Stutgardt and Munich
sw4138.dff	1	A	Think about taxes
sw4138.dff	2	B	I think they're a necessary evil
sw4138.dff	2	B	I wish the government would operate on the same premise that businesses operate on and that is
sw4138.dff	3	A	You spend what you have and
sw4138.dff	4	B	you don't spend more than you bring in
sw4138.dff	5	A	I think that the general idea is to (you) (know) spend during a time of recession (you) (know) for the deficit spending to help pick up the economy but (they're) (running) (under) (the) (assump-) the way they're running it now (they're) (you) (know) (running) (it) (under) a deficit spending while we're not under a recession so there's never any surplus coming in to counter the deficit that we're running (so) that's (kind) (of) a basic thing of economics (I) (guess) keep spending keep going into debt you're not going to payoff what you owe so (I) (guess) the question was more like do you (you) (know) get what you pay for
sw4138.dff	6	B	I it (just) depends
sw4138.dff	6	B	roads are very expensive commodity and so is utilities they supply and police and fire department they need to make a living
sw4138.dff	7	A	(There's)
sw4138.dff	8	B	So (I) (think) for many years we've paid teachers and police officers and firemen who are to a great extent public servants
sw4138.dff	10	B	(we) (have) (not) (paid) (them) (really) what they're worth in what they contribute to society
sw4138.dff	11	A	(I) (agree) (with) (that)
sw4138.dff	12	B	But (then) (again) it's hard to justify with all the wastefulness of money that the government spends on all levels of government including municipalities as well as state and federal governments
sw4138.dff	13	A	(I) (guess) I'm a student now and I don't make a whole lot of money (and) so I (kind) (of) don't pay a proportionate amount of taxes (I) (guess) compared to what I get because you know all my education is state sponsored
sw4138.dff	13	A	I go to a state sponsored school and my education all up through high school and stuff so (I) (guess) I'm (kind) (of) in debt (I) (suppose) because I don't (been) paying taxes all that long
sw4138.dff	13	A	My parents (I) (guess) (however) have contributed to that for the education side of it (and) (everything) but I usually end up getting money back
sw4138.dff	13	A	I will (this) (year) (anyway) (from) (a)
sw4138.dff	14	B	you're very fortunate
sw4138.dff	15	A	(I) (am)
sw4138.dff	17	A	I need it too (otherwise)
sw4138.dff	18	B	We just try not to pay any more in than we have to we pay in a substantial amount
sw4138.dff	20	B	We don't regret paying taxes
sw4138.dff	20	B	We do think that sometimes we have a reverse of a regressive tax a progressive tax
sw4138.dff	22	B	And progressive tax I think does not give people incentive to make more money and what I mean by that the more income you make the more tax you pay
sw4138.dff	23	A	(More) (taxes) (you) pay
sw4138.dff	24	B	It should be I think a flat percentage and that percentage ought to be an equitable amount
sw4138.dff	25	A	(Isn't)
sw4138.dff	26	B	last year when they passed the tax laws (for) (the) (nineteen) (ninety) (ninety-one) (whatever) (nineteen) (ninety-one)
sw4138.dff	28	B	I added up all the taxes that we were going to pay on all these different specific luxury items and travel expenses and
sw4138.dff	30	B	(everything) (else) (and) I totaled them all up and basically we were going to be paying seventy or eighty percent tax
sw4138.dff	31	A	(Wow)
sw4138.dff	32	B	that was the assumption that you spent that same dollar for every item on there
sw4138.dff	34	B	even though there's taxes on different things
sw4138.dff	35	A	(isn't)
sw4138.dff	36	B	But there's a lot of taxes you pay that you're not even aware (of) (that) you're paying like when you buy a tire you pay a federal excise tax
sw4138.dff	37	A	there's a lot of hidden taxes
sw4138.dff	38	B	You pay gasoline taxes every time you pump something into your
sw4138.dff	40	B	tank
sw4138.dff	41	A	The taxes that people don't think about (that) the income tax is a lot more visible portion of the taxes you pay (I) (guess)
sw4138.dff	42	B	But you (probably) pay more percentage wise in other taxes
sw4138.dff	43	A	(There) (was) (that)
sw4138.dff	45	A	(which) (can-) (was) (it) (Jerry) (Brown) one of the democratic candidates had a proposal for doing away with all the tax codes they have now and implementing (I) (think) a flat percentage (something) (like) (that)
sw4138.dff	46	B	if you implemented a flat percentage it would encourage people to make more money and what people need to understand in my opinion (now) (this) (is) (just) (my) (opinion) (okay) is that businesses create jobs and jobs create income and income pays taxes
sw4138.dff	48	B	(And) so if they penalize businesses business people are smart enough to say here's my break point I'm not going to work any harder
sw4138.dff	50	B	and make any more or create (any) more jobs
sw4138.dff	51	A	(Exactly)
sw4138.dff	51	A	(That's) (because)
sw4138.dff	52	B	(And) (so)
sw4138.dff	53	A	(until) (eight)
sw4138.dff	54	B	Based on that who do you think you're talking to you're talking to an employer
sw4138.dff	57	A	(Up) (until) (eighty-five) (or) (something) (was) (the)
sw4147.dff	1	A	Do you have any
sw4147.dff	2	B	Yes we do have a pet
sw4147.dff	2	B	We have a dog that we got from (the) we call it the S P C A
sw4147.dff	2	B	It's from an animal shelter
sw4147.dff	4	B	he'd come in there as a stray
sw4147.dff	5	A	(All)
sw4147.dff	6	B	he's a Pomeranian and Sheltie cross
sw4147.dff	8	B	he was very well trained when we got him
sw4147.dff	8	B	(he's)
sw4147.dff	9	A	(that's) (good)
sw4147.dff	9	A	You don't often find that I don't think
sw4147.dff	10	B	No we suspect that he (you) (know) got away from somebody traveling through and hurt in an accident
sw4147.dff	12	B	because a dog that looks as good as he does and is trained as well is someone that has lost him and not have been able to locate him
sw4147.dff	14	B	And if they were local people they would have been able to find him
sw4147.dff	15	A	(Sure)
sw4147.dff	15	A	(There's) (a) (okay) that's interesting
sw4147.dff	15	A	the only pet that I've had I'm a doctoral student now
sw4147.dff	17	A	(and) in my earlier days as a student I kind of time shared on a dog with a good friend of mine and it was an amazing dog (it) (really) (was)
sw4147.dff	17	A	he had gotten it from the pound and it's a Spanish Pointer named Domino
sw4147.dff	19	A	Kind of looks like a Dalmatian
sw4147.dff	21	A	and we trained it from a pup and (basically) now it's fully trained and it can do a lot of things
sw4147.dff	21	A	It will get beer for you out of the fridge and it will get the newspaper (and) (do) (all) (kinds) (of) (stuff)
sw4147.dff	21	A	(So) (it's) kind of a show piece (and) whenever anybody comes over we all have to show him Domino
sw4147.dff	22	B	(I) (think) (so)
sw4147.dff	23	A	(it's) she's been a real good dog and (just) it's kind of a shame that I'm away from it now
sw4147.dff	23	A	I (actually) live in Florida
sw4147.dff	25	A	but I'm on an internship up here for a year (and) then I go back down but Domino's a real good dog
sw4147.dff	27	A	what possessed you to get the dog
sw4147.dff	28	B	(I) (guess) in one sense we felt that it's nice to have a dog even though there are complications come with it
sw4147.dff	30	B	And then with our children at the time they were grade five and grade eight so
sw4147.dff	32	B	it was an age where we thought it be good for them to have the discipline that goes with having a pet
sw4147.dff	33	A	Sure
sw4147.dff	35	A	(Sure) learn a little bit of discipline and how to care for it and things like that
sw4147.dff	37	A	(That's) (good)
sw4147.dff	37	A	(That) (kind) (of) (builds) (some)
sw4147.dff	38	B	(So) ()
sw4147.dff	39	A	(character) (a) (little) (bit)
sw4147.dff	40	B	(that's) (the) (idea)
sw4147.dff	40	B	(I) (think) (the) (reality) (of) (it) (is) (that) (they) (perhaps) (it) (depends) (on) (the)
sw4147.dff	42	B	(on) (everyone's) (discipline)
sw4147.dff	44	B	And from that aspect I'm short on the discipline because I don't enforce that the kids look after the dog and we've had him about four years now
sw4147.dff	46	B	but I think (it) it's necessary that individuals have the discipline to look after the animal properly
sw4147.dff	47	A	that's something that's important for sure
sw4147.dff	49	A	I think do you live in a fairly rural part (of) (the)
sw4147.dff	51	A	(or)
sw4147.dff	52	B	Actually no we live in an area that's probably about two and a half miles from the university
sw4147.dff	53	A	(I) (see)
sw4147.dff	54	B	might say we live in the middle of a residential area
sw4147.dff	56	B	so that is not as good this dog being a small dog it's more acceptable
sw4147.dff	58	B	but again
sw4147.dff	59	A	it's not that big of a problem
sw4147.dff	59	A	With Domino she was full grown I would estimate seventy pounds
sw4147.dff	61	A	And we lived in Oviedo which is a small town it's a suburb of Orlando
sw4147.dff	63	A	but there wasn't a lot of room for her to run around and she was a dog that loved to run so that was the biggest problem I saw and I think that's one of the issues people need to think about before they get a dog is do you have the room for this dog to run around or (you) (know) I guess you can't really say for cats
sw4147.dff	63	A	Me and cats don't get along too well but that whole space issue I think is real important
sw4147.dff	64	B	that's one of the biggest concerns
sw4147.dff	64	B	(It's) there's a lot to be gained from a relationship with an animal but the same time one has to recognize the reality of physical requirements of
sw4147.dff	66	B	of the animal
sw4147.dff	67	A	(that)
sw4147.dff	68	B	and the larger they are the more room they need to exercise
sw4147.dff	69	A	(Sure) (and) that's all part of keeping your part of the relationship
sw4147.dff	71	A	showing the maturity and responsibility to recognize those issues
sw4147.dff	72	B	()
sw4147.dff	73	A	(and) (also) the whole thing with noise
sw4147.dff	73	A	My mother (she) freaks out because she's got neighbors that have dogs that don't train them
sw4147.dff	75	A	and we had a neighbor in Nebraska (when) (we) (lived) (there) that had Brittany Spaniels and they're very high strung animals to begin with (but)
sw4148.dff	1	B	Hi
sw4148.dff	2	A	Okay
sw4148.dff	2	A	with the issue of trial by jury I actually found the whole question about whether you need a unanimous verdict in a criminal case to be somewhat interesting
sw4148.dff	3	B	I agree that that's an interesting thing
sw4148.dff	3	B	I believe for civil suits it's not unanimous but for criminal suits it's unanimous by federal law
sw4148.dff	4	A	I don't know if it's even true that it's always unanimous because I thought there were cases (I) (don't) (know) if it's the difference between felonies and misdemeanors but where it was okay for a state to have it eleven out of twelve
sw4148.dff	5	B	I actually thought I'd read that too and that's why I phrased it that way
sw4148.dff	7	B	I wonder the difference could be that for if there is such a thing state felonies versus federal felonies that things that are under federal jurisdiction require the unanimous vote and things that are under state jurisdiction even criminal don't require but I don't know what the laws do you think that that's an unreasonable requirement that they be unanimous
sw4148.dff	8	A	I'd be curious as to what the requirement for an acquittal is
sw4148.dff	8	A	And I don't think it would be wrong to say that eleven out of twelve can convict if there were something corresponding saying that if six or seven voted not guilty then instead of it being a hung jury that was an acquittal
sw4148.dff	8	A	(But) (I) (don't) (know) (whether) (you) (need) (a) (unanimous) (vote) (of) (not) (guilty) (to) (acquit)
sw4148.dff	9	B	that would be an interesting change
sw4148.dff	9	B	It was also allow the idea that if you had one person who was very disagreeable that it fundamentally changes the way the processing occurs because the principle is that the fact that it's unanimous insures the beyond a reasonable doubt criterion (that) it increases the likelihood of getting the proper judgment
sw4148.dff	9	B	So I think if anything it would have to be a very close to unanimous decision
sw4148.dff	10	A	I'd agree with that
sw4148.dff	10	A	But I've never had the opportunity to serve on a jury although I've been out here and registered for (I) (guess) about five years
sw4148.dff	12	A	(But)
sw4148.dff	13	B	I thought that that would be very interesting thing to do
sw4148.dff	13	B	I would like to do that
sw4148.dff	13	B	I've been out here twenty some years and I've been called three different times but I've never actually even made it into the jury box
sw4148.dff	15	B	because there have always been a number of people and I've never gotten up there to answer any of the questions
sw4148.dff	15	B	(I) (I) also think that would be really good
sw4148.dff	15	B	(I)
sw4148.dff	16	A	the people I know who have served have said that usually what ends up happening is that after initially finding out where people stand that the whole deliberation usually results if there is (you) (know) something like a nine three or more severe and the people in the majority trying to convince the minority that they're
sw4148.dff	18	A	(and) in fact I'm not sure that that's any more liable to get rid of the reasonable doubt than anything else
sw4148.dff	19	B	the one thing that I know does seem to happen from people I've talked to on this is that in the situation you just said where it's nine to three or some such number that there's starts being a lot of peer pressure
sw4148.dff	21	B	going on (and) (that) (peer) (pressure) and in some cases if it's a long trial the desire of people to get out of there and not be stuck in there for a very long time (that) people are changing their minds for the wrong reasons
sw4148.dff	22	A	I'd
sw4148.dff	24	A	read one book I think it was calls TRIAL BY JURY of all things that
sw4148.dff	26	A	went through and interviewed a bunch of jurors in some of the big cases and in many cases looking at the evidence afterwards as to whether the decision was went back to the jurors based on the deliberations
sw4148.dff	26	A	Some of them did say that when they were the only one left opposing the verdict everyone was getting on them so heavily that eventually they just gave in knowing that nothing they could do could stop it from either being the verdict everyone else was trying for or a hung jury because the one vote doesn't mean anything except the ability to not have a verdict
sw4148.dff	27	B	(I) (understand)
sw4148.dff	27	B	you would hope that if you were in that situation that you'd have the moral fortitude to hold out if you believed that that was really the proper response
sw4148.dff	27	B	I think of the movie TWELVE ANGRY MEN
sw4148.dff	29	B	You ever seen that movie
sw4148.dff	30	A	once
sw4148.dff	31	B	it's exactly that situation where it's Henry Fonda and it's eleven to one and he's the one I believe he was opposed to the conviction and he held on (and)
sw4149.dff	20	B	(That) (sounds) (good)
sw4149.dff	21	A	we've been married for about ten years and we find out that no matter what kind of budget you stick on there's always going to be an unexpected car repair or something
sw4149.dff	23	A	happen with the house that you have to have money for and not enough to go and to take a loan out (but) (you) (have) (to) (have) (money) (for)
sw4149.dff	25	A	And then (we) (have) whatever's left over is discretionary income
sw4149.dff	27	A	that we use for the rest of the month and it's worked out very well
sw4149.dff	27	A	it's helped us so that we haven't been too long on the month and too short on the money (and)
sw4149.dff	28	B	(that's) (good)
sw4149.dff	29	A	(try) (and) (stick) (with) (that) (and) (nice) (thing) (about) (it) my wife is excellent in that we both work together we (both) have a budget and (we) stick to it
sw4149.dff	30	B	(good)
sw4149.dff	31	A	and there's no surprises in that
sw4149.dff	32	B	With two kids that could be hard
sw4149.dff	33	A	I have four kids
sw4149.dff	34	B	(Four)
sw4149.dff	35	A	I said a couple of kids I guess I should have specified (I) (have) (four)
sw4149.dff	36	B	(my) (goodness)
sw4149.dff	37	A	(four) (little) (boys)
sw4149.dff	38	B	(Four) (boys)
sw4149.dff	39	A	(You) (bet)
sw4149.dff	40	B	(my) (goodne-)
sw4149.dff	41	A	(You) (bet)
sw4149.dff	42	B	It's just me and my sister
sw4149.dff	43	A	(All)
sw4149.dff	44	B	And my parents divorced three years ago
sw4149.dff	46	B	and my sister had gotten through college but I was still in high school and my mother paid for a lot of my sister's college while my parents were together
sw4149.dff	47	A	(Yes)
sw4149.dff	48	B	and then before the divorce she had saved for my college
sw4149.dff	50	B	But when we had the divorce she just didn't get much money out of it and had to spend it all on getting another house
sw4149.dff	52	B	So now my dad's paying for all of my college (of)
sw4149.dff	53	A	(good) (good)
sw4149.dff	54	B	And financial aid
sw4149.dff	56	B	and scholarships
sw4149.dff	56	B	I'm a music major so I have auditions coming up
sw4149.dff	57	A	(Yes) what year are you in in college
sw4149.dff	58	B	I'm a sophomore
sw4149.dff	59	A	(You're) (a) (sophomore) you have a few more years
sw4149.dff	60	B	I'll probably have about two and a half years left
sw4149.dff	61	A	(good) (for) (you)
sw4149.dff	61	A	(Good) (for) (you)
sw4149.dff	61	A	I imagine it is a little difficult to stick with a budget (during) (that) during school (and) (so) (it) (forth)
sw4149.dff	62	B	(it) (sure) (is)
sw4149.dff	62	B	I know how much my dad is going to give me every two weeks
sw4149.dff	63	A	(Yes)
sw4149.dff	64	B	and I don't spend over that
sw4149.dff	65	A	(great) (great)
sw4149.dff	65	A	And sometimes that's a little hard with books and music and sheet music and stuff you've got to work on too
sw4149.dff	66	B	(sure) there's always music
sw4149.dff	67	A	Lab fees and all
sw4149.dff	68	B	books to buy
sw4149.dff	69	A	(yes) (yes)
sw4149.dff	69	A	you're not a starving artist yet are you
sw4149.dff	70	B	no (no) (no)
sw4149.dff	71	A	(Good)
sw4149.dff	72	B	I don't plan on being a starving artist
sw4149.dff	73	A	(good)
sw4149.dff	74	B	That's why I'm in college
sw4149.dff	75	A	there's enough of those in the world
sw4149.dff	77	A	(Good) (good) I'm glad to hear that (Wendy)
sw4149.dff	77	A	(W-)
sw4149.dff	78	B	That's usually because they're not real educated
sw4149.dff	78	B	They can't afford to have a really good job
sw4149.dff	79	A	who's not very well educated
sw4149.dff	80	B	The starving ones
sw4149.dff	81	A	(yes) (yes)
sw4149.dff	82	B	There's enough out there that if you're educated enough then you can make money
sw4149.dff	83	A	(That's) (true) (that's) (true)
sw4149.dff	83	A	I found that out
sw4149.dff	85	A	So that's why I'm planning and preparing for the education of my children also
sw4149.dff	87	A	try and set that money aside
sw4149.dff	88	B	What did you major in
sw4149.dff	89	A	I majored in business administration
sw4149.dff	90	B	(good) you know plenty about planning a budget
sw4149.dff	91	A	(but) (once) (again)
sw4150.dff	1	A	(All)
sw4150.dff	2	B	(Yes)
sw4150.dff	3	A	(Okay)
sw4150.dff	3	A	How many kids do you have
sw4150.dff	4	B	I think we're going to talk about parents spending time with their children
sw4150.dff	4	B	We
sw4150.dff	6	B	have three children who are eleven nine and eight
sw4150.dff	6	B	So this is the big issue with us
sw4150.dff	6	B	Although I don't recall marking it on my little things to talk about but
sw4150.dff	8	B	perhaps they are little for words to be said like day care and quality time (and)
sw4150.dff	10	B	(Anyway)
sw4150.dff	10	B	You don't have children
sw4150.dff	11	A	No
sw4150.dff	12	B	But you're married
sw4150.dff	13	A	we've been married for two and a half years
sw4150.dff	13	A	We've been trying for about two years but
sw4150.dff	15	A	no luck yet
sw4150.dff	15	A	Hopefully
sw4150.dff	16	B	I know we're not supposed to do this long distance but I'm getting a call
sw4150.dff	16	B	I wonder if I could possibly take it on call waiting
sw4150.dff	16	B	Could I ask you to hold one minute
sw4150.dff	18	B	I'll be back
sw4150.dff	18	B	Excuse me
sw4150.dff	19	A	(Had-)
sw4150.dff	20	B	just a moment
sw4150.dff	20	B	They're going to get mad
sw4150.dff	21	A	She had another call
sw4150.dff	21	A	She has just three kids eleven nine and eight
sw4150.dff	22	B	(Hello)
sw4150.dff	24	B	(I'm) (so) (sorry)
sw4150.dff	25	A	(All)
sw4150.dff	26	B	That was my daughter's Brownie leader telling me that there is a meeting tomorrow
sw4150.dff	27	A	(Okay)
sw4150.dff	28	B	(Brownie) (meeting)
sw4150.dff	29	A	(That) (keeps) (you) (bu-)
sw4150.dff	31	A	do you have a lot of activities with your kids
sw4150.dff	32	B	(I) (don't) (want) (this) (to) (be) (a) (unilateral) (conversation) (but) yes we do
sw4150.dff	34	B	Both my husband and I work and our children are sixth fourth and third grade
sw4150.dff	34	B	And the school years are wonderful (they're) (just) (wonderful)
sw4150.dff	36	B	(The) (kids) they are real people and they are interesting and
sw4150.dff	38	B	they have all their own activities and (I) (think) as parents we really enjoy them in our personal situation our children have not yet decided to rebel
sw4150.dff	39	A	So they're pretty good kids
sw4150.dff	40	B	I'm sure that's coming though
sw4150.dff	40	B	(But)
sw4150.dff	42	B	(they) (are) (wonderful) (kids)
sw4150.dff	43	A	(we) (had) (ni-) (wh-) (growing) (up) (I) (guess) (I) (can) (talk) (about) (us)
sw4150.dff	43	A	We had nine kids in our family
sw4150.dff	43	A	(We) (had) eight boys and one girl
sw4150.dff	43	A	(But) (my) (Dad)
sw4150.dff	44	B	(You) (had) (eight) (boys) (and) (one) (girl)
sw4150.dff	45	A	(And) (the) (time) (that) (we) (spent) (with) our Dad (was) (he) owned his own business so we worked with him most of the time
sw4150.dff	45	A	(So) (that's) (how) (we) (spent) (most) (of) (the) (time) (with) (him)
sw4150.dff	46	B	Are you Mormons
sw4150.dff	48	B	(That's) (what) (the) Utah and the large family
sw4150.dff	49	A	That was a dead giveaway
sw4150.dff	50	B	we're Catholics
sw4150.dff	50	B	I came from a family of five
sw4150.dff	50	B	I had four brothers
sw4150.dff	52	B	the only girl
sw4150.dff	54	B	And everyone always asked if the girl got spoiled
sw4150.dff	55	A	(that)
sw4150.dff	56	B	I never felt spoiled
sw4150.dff	58	B	(In) (fact) I always thought my toys were destroyed
sw4150.dff	59	A	(I) (was) (going) (to) (say) my sister wasn't spoiled very much
sw4150.dff	60	B	No
sw4150.dff	60	B	Usually busy fighting for survival
sw4150.dff	61	A	(that's)
sw4150.dff	61	A	(But)
sw4150.dff	62	B	I do think with working parents (I) (mean) there are some real issues here
sw4150.dff	64	B	(that) (I) (think) (I) (don't) (know)
sw4150.dff	64	B	It's an interesting problem
sw4150.dff	64	B	(I) (happen) (to) I'm a pediatrician
sw4150.dff	66	B	My husband is a physician so I talk to parents about this a lot
sw4150.dff	66	B	But (children) I think working mothers (or) (mothers) (who) (choose) (to) (work) (outside) (the) (home) need very early to come to grips with any guilt
sw4150.dff	68	B	that they feel and decide what's best for them and their family
sw4150.dff	70	B	And I feel when my children were very young I had jobs that helped me be flexible with my schedule and spend time with them (and) (all) (that) (sort) (of) (thing)
sw4150.dff	70	B	And I long ago decided I'm a better mother because I work outside the home
sw4150.dff	72	B	I really believe that
sw4150.dff	72	B	And it has helped us to afford some things for our children that we couldn't otherwise that I think are wonderful particularly at this age and I think our kids are real secure
sw4150.dff	74	B	And have a real sense of priorities and that they can do anything and be anything both male and female (a) (lot) so I know it sounds like a rationalization but I really think it's true for our family
sw4150.dff	76	B	and I think it has worked very well
sw4150.dff	77	A	It's like you said to each his own
sw4150.dff	77	A	And we're planning on having my wife stay home
sw4150.dff	77	A	(but)
sw4150.dff	78	B	There's no question I think that's really the best
sw4150.dff	78	B	if a woman is happy doing that
sw4150.dff	80	B	I hate to put it quite that way
sw4150.dff	82	B	I was twenty-nine when I had my first child and I would not have been real fulfilled
sw4150.dff	82	B	I really would not have been totally staying home with a young child
sw4150.dff	84	B	it's wonderful to be a mother but I like the way I did it
sw4150.dff	86	B	I sort of worked half time
sw4150.dff	86	B	I had very flexible hours
sw4150.dff	86	B	I nursed all three of our children until they were at least a year (and) (I)
sw4150.dff	88	B	you can do that despite working very easily which is one of the things I preach all the time to (to) mothers
sw4151.dff	1	A	Do you ever think that there's a crime that's just so heinous and so bad that the person who commits this crime just doesn't deserve to live anymore
sw4151.dff	2	B	(That's) (a) (good) (question)
sw4151.dff	2	B	there was a point where I would have said no that no one would deserve to die for a crime that he committed
sw4151.dff	2	B	But since I've become a parent and since I've seen things like Jeffrey Dahlmer I really have to question that
sw4151.dff	2	B	I can't conceive of someone being that brutal to that many other people
sw4151.dff	4	B	And try and figure out what would be a suitable punishment
sw4151.dff	5	A	Of the statements made by people against the death penalty I like the statement made by Cuomo
sw4151.dff	5	A	Cuomo (I) (believe) is (he's) governor of New York but he's against the death penalty
sw4151.dff	5	A	But he said that he would want to seriously hurt or if not kill someone if they did something to his wife
sw4151.dff	5	A	(And) (that's) (but) even in that situation he would hope that there would be people around him who would keep him from doing the things
sw4151.dff	6	B	it's a question of your gut reactions to something like that versus an intelligent reason response
sw4151.dff	7	A	(exactly)
sw4151.dff	8	B	and that was the thing that killed Dukakis back four years ago when someone asked him a similar question and he thought for a second and gave a thoughtful well reasoned reply when people wanted to see if he was going to go for an emotion
sw4151.dff	10	B	a gut level reaction
sw4151.dff	10	B	And I think that the people who are strongly in favor of the death penalty are really working from that gut level
sw4151.dff	10	B	whether it be a biblical force the eye for an eye a tooth for a tooth a life for a knife life type logic or just some sort of anger at (putting) (peop-) putting murderers up in federal pens for the rest of their life while we foot the bill
sw4151.dff	12	B	I think people are working at that from more of a gut reaction than a reason humane one
sw4151.dff	13	A	I don't think the decisions that are going to be made on the death penalty until we decide what our prison system is intended to do
sw4151.dff	13	A	Are they reformatories where we're trying to take people who can't survive or that aren't conforming enough to society so that we work well together
sw4151.dff	13	A	Or are they is it a penal institution
sw4151.dff	13	A	is it designed for punishment
sw4151.dff	13	A	the death penalty surely fits in well in a penal situation where you're trying to punishment
sw4151.dff	13	A	perhaps not in the manner that we do it but in theory it fits in
sw4151.dff	13	A	in a reformatory if you put someone to death you obviously
sw4151.dff	15	A	can't reform them
sw4151.dff	16	B	(That's) (true)
sw4151.dff	18	B	the other argument is that the death penalty is a deterrent and I really don't agree with that
sw4151.dff	18	B	I don't think anyone who would commit a crime that would get them the death penalty would stop at the moment and say I was about to kill and dismember this person but if they catch me they're going to kill me so I better not do it
sw4151.dff	18	B	(I) (just)
sw4152.dff	13	A	They have
sw4152.dff	13	A	(They) (have)
sw4152.dff	13	A	They moved it up to the county north of here
sw4152.dff	15	A	it's in Ventura and there's still quite a bit of publicity obviously and it's kind of debatable whether you could get a fair trial almost anywhere (because) (that)
sw4152.dff	16	B	that videotape was just horrible
sw4152.dff	17	A	It was everywhere
sw4152.dff	18	B	(Yes)
sw4152.dff	19	A	and I think it would be very difficult to find a panel that would not have seen it and known of what was going on
sw4152.dff	20	B	I agree with you but I can't imagine that they would do an all white jury without having some sort of discrimination or (you) (know) appeal on not having a jury of his peers and all of that kind of stuff
sw4152.dff	21	A	(Exactly)
sw4152.dff	21	A	(the) I'm kind of torn on this issue
sw4152.dff	21	A	It's like they're saying on the one hand he's not getting a jury of his peers which is in some ways I think true
sw4152.dff	21	A	But on the other hand it's also saying that white jurors are not going to convict
sw4152.dff	23	A	they're not going to do their job
sw4152.dff	23	A	Which is the whole point of being on a jury is to convict or let go based on whether
sw4152.dff	24	B	(Exactly)
sw4152.dff	25	A	or not the person whether or not the evidence says
sw4152.dff	26	B	(Based) (on) (fact)
sw4152.dff	27	A	that there's enough
sw4152.dff	28	B	(How) (interesting)
sw4152.dff	28	B	what's the prevailing thought within the community
sw4152.dff	30	B	you know what the news media is going to make of it but what about the community
sw4152.dff	31	A	(They) I guess it depends on who you talk to
sw4152.dff	31	A	I haven't talked to a whole lot of black people on it but I rather imagine there's some snickering about it
sw4152.dff	31	A	And a lot of the usually fatalistic here we go again folks
sw4152.dff	33	A	kind of stuff
sw4152.dff	34	B	(my) (goodness)
sw4152.dff	34	B	That can't be good for Los Angeles either
sw4152.dff	35	A	(No) (no)
sw4152.dff	35	A	(I) (you) (know) on the one hand you almost hope that they convict them because they have that very strong piece of physical evidence showing
sw4152.dff	36	B	(exactly)
sw4152.dff	37	A	these people beating the heck out of this guy
sw4152.dff	38	B	Unfortunately that kind of thing is not limited to a big city like Los Angeles
sw4152.dff	38	B	You're going to have it just about anywhere
sw4152.dff	40	B	(There)
sw4152.dff	42	B	But that's interesting
sw4152.dff	44	B	What about the judge who's hearing the case
sw4152.dff	44	B	Is he going to be impartial
sw4152.dff	44	B	Is he going to
sw4152.dff	46	B	be a good adjudicator
sw4152.dff	47	A	I don't know
sw4152.dff	47	A	and again there's something else along those lines
sw4152.dff	47	A	There was a girl out here named Latausha Harlins
sw4152.dff	47	A	I don't know if it's got as much notoriety but it's rather almost as infamous here as it was with the Rodney King problem
sw4152.dff	47	A	a girl walked into a Korean owned store (and) (she) (had) (a) (dispute) (black) (girl)
sw4152.dff	49	A	she had some kind of a dispute over some orange juice with the owner of the store
sw4152.dff	49	A	The owner of the store popped her
sw4152.dff	50	B	(really)
sw4152.dff	51	A	and of course (they) the criminal case went up and the judge gave the woman who shot the girl practically a suspended sentence
sw4152.dff	51	A	(it) (was)
sw4152.dff	52	B	(my) (goodness)
sw4152.dff	53	A	it was just she gave her no time in jail all of these things and then (we) (have) (these) we have people (wondering) (around) (to-) with petitions trying to get the judge
sw4152.dff	54	B	To get that judge recalled I would think
sw4152.dff	56	B	That's almost when you kind of wish that there where standardized sentences
sw4152.dff	57	A	it would make life easier
sw4152.dff	58	B	(It) (would)
sw4152.dff	61	A	(But)
sw4152.dff	62	B	the whole world would know what you were facing
sw4152.dff	62	B	And then it's a matter of deciding
sw4153.dff	1	A	(Okay)
sw4153.dff	1	A	I used to work in a day care center
sw4153.dff	3	A	I worked in all the different areas of the day care center and they can be deceiving to people
sw4153.dff	3	A	I did not work there long because I couldn't handle the treatment that the children got and this is supposed to be a very well-known center here in Tyler who had two or three centers
sw4153.dff	5	A	all over the city and they would be one way when the parents were there and be another way when the parents left
sw4153.dff	7	A	I think (you) (know) if you do day care centers you should make frequent checks to check in on them when they're not expecting it
sw4153.dff	9	A	Because they do things differently when you're not around (so)
sw4153.dff	10	B	(that) I know (wh-) the things that we kind of looked at is you want to see how many teachers you have
sw4153.dff	12	B	and how many kids they have and how they break it up
sw4153.dff	14	B	Because we had one that sounds kind of like what you were in
sw4153.dff	16	B	it was a really good one and in fact it worked out for us because we kind of bartered
sw4153.dff	16	B	My wife did artwork for them you know so we got our day care free
sw4153.dff	18	B	But they didn't have enough teachers (and)
sw4153.dff	19	A	this one was set up good
sw4153.dff	19	A	they had two teachers
sw4153.dff	21	A	to every room
sw4153.dff	21	A	sometimes three
sw4153.dff	21	A	And they had a good system so when you walked in everything looks cool
sw4153.dff	23	A	The problem I had was that they did not show affection to the children enough
sw4153.dff	23	A	(They) (did) (not) (show) (them) (care) (to) (these) (small) (children) (who) (are) (being) (left)
sw4153.dff	25	A	(they) one time I picked up this little boy who was crying and the owner came and just chewed me up one side down the other
sw4153.dff	27	A	he said you are going to have every child in here wanting you to pick them up
sw4153.dff	29	A	And I said no this child was crying and needed some comfort
sw4153.dff	31	A	what is your problem
sw4153.dff	32	B	did they separate them by age group
sw4153.dff	33	A	(Yes)
sw4153.dff	34	B	Because you know I think that's one thing that was important
sw4153.dff	35	A	they had the babies that didn't walk in one room
sw4153.dff	37	A	The ones that were starting to walk in one room
sw4153.dff	37	A	Then they had the three year olds upper fours lower fours upper fives lower fives
sw4153.dff	37	A	just like that
sw4153.dff	39	A	they really did separate them well
sw4153.dff	40	B	(it) (sound)
sw4153.dff	41	A	It was just the teachers themselves
sw4153.dff	42	B	It sounds like (to) (me) your concern would be to make sure that they are loving people
sw4153.dff	45	A	(But) (that) (they're) (not)
sw4153.dff	46	B	(Affectionate) (people) (that) (they're) (they're) (kind) (of) (par-)
sw4153.dff	47	A	(Their) (system)
sw4153.dff	48	B	may be parents themselves or something
sw4153.dff	49	A	(but) their system was great (but) (you) (know) the caring just wasn't there
sw4153.dff	51	A	The one woman that did the babies
sw4153.dff	51	A	I worked with her and she was fabulous
sw4153.dff	53	A	She loved them babies (and) (she) (loved) (them) and cared for them
sw4153.dff	53	A	But every one of the others that I saw was just screaming and yelling and would make me a nervous wreck
sw4153.dff	54	B	I think that's probably a really important thing because you can have doctorates and P H D's (and) (all) (that) (kind) (of) (thing) and know all the technical stuff but if they don't reach out and touch the kids then that doesn't do any good
sw4153.dff	55	A	these kids are just in a day care center all day
sw4153.dff	57	A	and with any type of emotional getting care they're just there
sw4153.dff	59	A	Going through this routine
sw4153.dff	60	B	(An-)
sw4153.dff	61	A	which is lousy
sw4153.dff	62	B	(the) (other) (group) (that) (we) (had) (was) (kind) (of) (interesting)
sw4153.dff	62	B	The other one we went to it was a husband and wife team
sw4153.dff	64	B	and we knew them from other associations but it was (kind) (of) interesting because she was (kind) (of) the strict one and I think she'd put her arm around the kids and talk to them and stuff but he was actually the more demonstrative type
sw4153.dff	66	B	The more loving he would laugh with the kids and play with the kids (and)
sw4153.dff	68	B	(and) (i-) (it) (was) (kind) (of) (interesting) (to) (see) (that) that it was actually the man in the group (that) that did that side of it
sw4153.dff	68	B	(An-)
sw4153.dff	69	A	you don't see that much
sw4153.dff	70	B	so they had a really nice balance
sw4153.dff	70	B	We liked that one
sw4153.dff	70	B	In fact it was called Humpty Dumpty Play School or something
sw4153.dff	71	A	(That's) (cute)
sw4153.dff	72	B	but they also did some of the teaching things and (then) (they) (had) obedience was important
sw4153.dff	73	A	that has to be with a day care center
sw4153.dff	74	B	(you) (know) (so) I think they used the you probably heard (you) (know) where you stand in front of the clock and get your power back to control yourself
sw4153.dff	75	A	I've never heard of that
sw4153.dff	75	A	(that's) (a) (new) (one)
sw4153.dff	76	B	(And) (it's) (one)
sw4153.dff	77	A	(on) (me)
sw4153.dff	78	B	I can't remember what they call it actually but you just stand them in front of a clock and it has a second-hand that goes around
sw4153.dff	80	B	And they have to stand there
sw4154.dff	15	A	in the Mideast
sw4154.dff	16	B	we tend to be pretty strong supporters of Israel ourselves
sw4154.dff	18	B	we kind of cringe when they make mistakes but yet
sw4154.dff	20	B	overall tend to support them
sw4154.dff	20	B	But I think one of the most interesting things to me recently was during the war
sw4154.dff	22	B	in Kuwait was the fact that they did not retaliate
sw4154.dff	24	B	for the scud missiles that were launched there
sw4154.dff	24	B	That just seemed to me to be a phenomenal demonstration of restraint and it must have reflected some awful good diplomacy on the part of the U S
sw4154.dff	25	A	but on the other hand if they would have had a hard time retaliating because you know they wouldn't have been given access to the friend or foe codes
sw4154.dff	26	B	(I) (see)
sw4154.dff	27	A	through two enemies
sw4154.dff	28	B	you don't think they got the codes from the U S already
sw4154.dff	29	A	The U S would claim that they would have not given them to them
sw4154.dff	30	B	(I) (see)
sw4154.dff	31	A	(of) (course) (public) (statements) (can) (be) (taken) (for)
sw4154.dff	32	B	(That's) (true)
sw4154.dff	32	B	(yet) (they)
sw4154.dff	35	A	(D-)
sw4154.dff	36	B	(what) (do) (y-) what about this situation with (you) (know) the continual harassment by Iraq now and apparently failing to let the arms inspectors have free access
sw4154.dff	37	A	to begin with I pretty much question what the U S -s motives were in actually the original involvement
sw4154.dff	39	A	(I) the cynical side of me says that it was more for the domestic political situation than for anything else
sw4154.dff	40	B	(okay)
sw4154.dff	41	A	(you) (know) and for portraying Bush is a strong President
sw4154.dff	42	B	(Sure)
sw4154.dff	43	A	my gut feeling is that he pretty much picked the fight with Hussein
sw4154.dff	45	A	I'm not saying at all that Hussein wasn't quite willing to enter that fight
sw4154.dff	47	A	But I think that we chose to have our official feelings hurt
sw4154.dff	49	A	(Where) (a) (lot) (w-)
sw4154.dff	50	B	do you think that we should ignore it and just allowed him to go ahead and
sw4154.dff	52	B	move on into Kuwait and see what happens
sw4154.dff	53	A	I think that in the past we've allowed lots of things like that to happen
sw4154.dff	55	A	And (I) (really) (don't) (think) (that) I think (it) (was) there were a lot more demographic related interests involved than true foreign policy interests
sw4154.dff	58	B	may have been
sw4154.dff	58	B	I'm not saying that that's not the case
sw4154.dff	59	A	And along this line (since) it really didn't accomplish very much except we're getting the Iraqis out of Kuwait
sw4154.dff	61	A	I don't foresee Bush making the decision to invest a lot of manpower and money (and) in fighting a second battle
sw4154.dff	62	B	(No)
sw4154.dff	63	A	over what probably won't accomplish much for him politically
sw4154.dff	64	B	(No) it doesn't look like we're getting ready to do much more in there
sw4154.dff	66	B	Even at this point
sw4154.dff	68	B	(what) (about) do you have any views on Israel's relation to the U S
sw4154.dff	68	B	Do you
sw4154.dff	70	B	think we ought to
sw4154.dff	72	B	back off on our support of the country (or) (what) (do) (yo-)
sw4154.dff	73	A	I have very fixed feelings about Israel
sw4154.dff	73	A	(I) (think) (that) (for) (a) (long) (while) (we've) (had) (almost) (a) (ha-) (t-)
sw4155.dff	1	A	what's our topic
sw4155.dff	2	B	Taxes
sw4155.dff	3	A	(Taxes)
sw4155.dff	4	B	Do we pay too much
sw4155.dff	6	B	(do) (we)
sw4155.dff	7	A	What do you do
sw4155.dff	9	A	I guess (that) it all depends really on what kind of bracket you're in
sw4155.dff	10	B	My tax bracket is pretty high up there
sw4155.dff	10	B	I generally pay the maximum tax bracket
sw4155.dff	12	B	And I think that we're paying too much because I don't have any children
sw4155.dff	14	B	And I pay a lot of property taxes
sw4155.dff	15	A	(sure)
sw4155.dff	16	B	(you) (know) I don't use an awful lot of city services
sw4155.dff	16	B	(It) (it)
sw4155.dff	18	B	(it's) (like) (I) (have) (to) (work) (m-) I have to work all the time
sw4155.dff	20	B	just to make enough money to pay the taxes
sw4155.dff	22	B	And there's so many people who want a dib of the federal money
sw4155.dff	24	B	or the state money (or) (whatever) (it) (is) (and) (I) (just) many times I end up feeling like I'm paying too much in taxes
sw4155.dff	26	B	(How) (about) (you)
sw4155.dff	26	B	Do you pay too much
sw4155.dff	27	A	no I can't really complain
sw4155.dff	27	A	I'm a student and I work as a co-op at Georgia Tech Research Institute
sw4155.dff	27	A	And I'm going to get back (I) (mean) most of what I pay in taxes and
sw4155.dff	28	B	(when) (you)
sw4155.dff	29	A	one of my parents is still claiming me
sw4155.dff	30	B	(when) (you) (go) (out) (into) (the) when you go out into the working world
sw4155.dff	32	B	it changes quickly
sw4155.dff	33	A	(I'm) (sure)
sw4155.dff	34	B	you look at your paycheck and you go my gosh where did it all go
sw4155.dff	36	B	(what) (kind) (of) (have) (you) (pay) (a) (lot) (of) (in) (ta-) have you been out working and then gone back to school or did you go directly from high school into college
sw4155.dff	37	A	(I) (went) I did work for some time but I didn't make enough money (to) (really) (make)
sw4155.dff	38	B	(To) (worry) (about) (it)
sw4155.dff	39	A	(too) (much) (of) (a) (difference)
sw4155.dff	40	B	have you been active in politics concerning this
sw4155.dff	40	B	Have you worked on political action committees or something like that
sw4155.dff	41	A	(No) (no) I haven't
sw4155.dff	42	B	I haven't done any of that type of work (myself)
sw4155.dff	44	B	but every once in a while (when) I hear (up) (here) in D C area one of the radio stations has been talking about (the) Congress Congress has added (too) towards the Members Bank (there) (there's) a bank that they all bank with and (I) (guess) it went defunct recently
sw4155.dff	46	B	And one of the Congressmen has written in the last three years about a thousand bad checks
sw4155.dff	48	B	And we (the) taxpayers float him a loan for all those bad checks
sw4155.dff	50	B	no interest no repayment schedule
sw4155.dff	51	A	(Really)
sw4155.dff	52	B	And it's causing quite a stir (up) here
sw4155.dff	54	B	because we're so close to D C (anyway)
sw4155.dff	56	B	It's really kind of curious to watch this thing occur
sw4155.dff	57	A	(sure)
sw4155.dff	58	B	I think we pay too much
sw4155.dff	58	B	And I look at my paycheck (and) I (make) (let's) (see)
sw4155.dff	58	B	They take out in state and federal taxes
sw4155.dff	60	B	I think I pay forty-two percent
sw4155.dff	61	A	(Wow)
sw4155.dff	62	B	Forty-two cents out of every dollar I make goes to the government
sw4155.dff	64	B	and then they charge (me) sales tax and (they) (charge) (me) gasoline taxes
sw4155.dff	65	A	(taxes)
sw4155.dff	66	B	and they charge me all these others and it's just too expensive
sw4155.dff	68	B	I can't believe that I'm just thankful (that) I don't get all the government that I pay for
sw4155.dff	70	B	(You) (know) (what) (I) (mean)
sw4155.dff	72	B	have you used student loans and things like that that were guaranteed by the government
sw4155.dff	73	A	(No) (no) I haven't
sw4155.dff	73	A	my father pays for my tuition
sw4155.dff	73	A	I haven't made use of that
sw4155.dff	74	B	What are you studying (down) (there)
sw4158.dff	1	A	are you working now
sw4158.dff	2	B	yes I am
sw4158.dff	2	B	I'm working in the computer science department here
sw4158.dff	4	B	at C M U
sw4158.dff	5	A	what kind of work do you do
sw4158.dff	6	B	I'm doing basically system design
sw4158.dff	8	B	work and implementation work for the speech group
sw4158.dff	10	B	here
sw4158.dff	11	A	(Wh-) is that how you heard about this thing
sw4158.dff	14	B	actually through electronic mail
sw4158.dff	15	A	Me too
sw4158.dff	15	A	I work at the Georgia Tech Research Institute
sw4158.dff	17	A	I'm a co-op student so I work and go to school about halftime
sw4158.dff	17	A	And I really don't have any job benefits to speak of
sw4158.dff	17	A	(We're) (kind) (of) (I) (don't) (know) they just (kind) (of) forget us on that end
sw4158.dff	17	A	We don't really have any vacation or sick days or health care or anything really (so)
sw4158.dff	18	B	So it's pretty fair they've got you slaving away
sw4158.dff	19	A	(Exactly)
sw4158.dff	20	B	at this point
sw4158.dff	21	A	(Exactly)
sw4158.dff	23	A	What about you
sw4158.dff	24	B	I'm research stuff here now so they have okay benefits package
sw4158.dff	24	B	It's not quite as good as industry but one of the significant benefits here is that you can take up to two courses a semester and they pay for
sw4158.dff	26	B	(pay) (for) the classes
sw4158.dff	26	B	So
sw4158.dff	28	B	Carnegie Mellon that works out to be a reasonable benefit
sw4158.dff	29	A	they do that I think if you're research here then I know of some of the people that have gotten their masters and I think that they might pay for that
sw4158.dff	31	A	Pay for the classes and stuff but I know they'll let you decrease how many hours you work by kind of percentage
sw4158.dff	31	A	they'll let you work halftime if you want to finish
sw4158.dff	32	B	If you want to
sw4158.dff	33	A	(you) (want) (to)
sw4158.dff	34	B	do it quickly
sw4158.dff	35	A	They'll let you (work) decrease your number of hours by any percentage just about (so) if you want to get your masters (and) (then) (I) (think) of course with your extra degrees you get a pay raise due so
sw4158.dff	37	A	that will probably help out
sw4158.dff	37	A	(But)
sw4158.dff	38	B	So I don't know in terms of other things other benefits other than (sort) (of) monetary (you) (know) (I)
sw4158.dff	39	A	Do you get any kind of health care type stuff
sw4158.dff	40	B	we do
sw4158.dff	40	B	We have to contribute a certain amount to it
sw4158.dff	42	B	And it's kind of split between C M U (and)
sw4158.dff	44	B	(and) the employee
sw4158.dff	45	A	(I) (think)
sw4158.dff	47	A	that's a pretty important part of it there because that can be really expensive if you ever have any health problems
sw4158.dff	47	A	(I) (think) (my) I'm still covered with my dad's health plan where he works (but)
sw4158.dff	49	A	it would definitely be something to look into once I get my own
sw4158.dff	50	B	and now (it's) (the) like everywhere else here in Pittsburgh the health care rates are going up pretty quickly
sw4158.dff	52	B	That's a whole other topic
sw4158.dff	53	A	(They) (have)
sw4158.dff	54	B	to begin with too (but)
sw4158.dff	54	B	but (you) (are) I really agree that that's pretty important
sw4158.dff	55	A	(I) guess the only real benefit (I) (guess) you could say working here besides (I'm) learning and stuff because
sw4158.dff	57	A	(I'm) (you) (know) (in) (school)
sw4158.dff	57	A	(But)
sw4158.dff	59	A	there's some weird law where student employees working for the government
sw4158.dff	61	A	don't have to pay Social Security tax
sw4158.dff	63	A	(Though)
sw4158.dff	64	B	(Now) (that's) (a) (big) (win)
sw4158.dff	65	A	that's about
sw4158.dff	67	A	five percent there (so)
sw4158.dff	68	B	(That's)
sw4158.dff	69	A	That's about the only real bonus
sw4158.dff	71	A	so I have to take that into consideration when I evaluate how much I get paid (real) because if I was working somewhere else I'd have to pay an extra five percent
sw4158.dff	73	A	or so
sw4158.dff	74	B	(I) (figured) (for) (and) they've just raised the income caps on Social Security to the point where
sw4158.dff	76	B	you have to be pretty well off before you stop paying
sw4158.dff	78	B	paying that as well
sw4158.dff	78	B	if you could call it a benefit that C M U (i-) the other thing that they allow you to do here while you are working (is) is consult for other companies
sw4158.dff	80	B	so that kind of helps out in terms of
sw4158.dff	82	B	keeping up-to-date with contacts in industry
sw4158.dff	84	B	in case
sw4158.dff	85	A	(help) (a) (lot)
sw4158.dff	86	B	in case you ever need to bail out
sw4158.dff	87	A	around here it's like we pretty much work from project to project well (you) (know) with different sponsors
sw4158.dff	89	A	there is not a whole lot of funded research from
sw4159.dff	28	B	(it) (really) (ultimately) (is) (not) (penalizing) (the) (person) (that) (they're) (trying) (for) (get) (away)
sw4159.dff	29	A	(That's) (true)
sw4159.dff	30	B	If it's a company you know that they're insured
sw4159.dff	30	B	Unless the award is so staggering that it goes (all) beyond their layers of insurance which is another pet peeve of mine when they do award punitive damages
sw4159.dff	32	B	I think those should be uninsurable
sw4159.dff	32	B	I think those should have to be paid by the corporation itself (that)
sw4159.dff	33	A	(out) (of) (thei-) (r-)
sw4159.dff	34	B	(that) (did) (the) (damage)
sw4159.dff	35	A	As opposed to the insurance paying the bills
sw4159.dff	39	A	(we're)
sw4159.dff	40	B	for honest mistakes where they've done something and something happens
sw4159.dff	40	B	One of their employees causes damage or something
sw4159.dff	41	A	(Wh-)
sw4159.dff	42	B	That's what they buy insurance for
sw4159.dff	43	A	(Who) (who) do they get (they) (get) (insured) (they) (get) insured from other insurance companies or how does that work
sw4159.dff	44	B	I was just talking about any company
sw4159.dff	45	A	(okay) (your) (talking) (about) (corpor-)
sw4159.dff	46	B	let's just say a lumber manufacturing company and
sw4159.dff	47	A	(Sure)
sw4159.dff	48	B	somebody is on the premises and one of the employees actually is driving by with a forklift and he pushes the wrong button and he drops a load of lumber on somebody and it injures
sw4159.dff	49	A	(Okay)
sw4159.dff	50	B	them
sw4159.dff	52	B	(Sure)
sw4159.dff	52	B	Insurance should pay for that
sw4159.dff	53	A	But in some instances you're going to put companies out of business by taking that stance if they have to take it out of their own retained earnings
sw4159.dff	54	B	I'm not talking about any loss
sw4159.dff	54	B	I was talking about only losses that are judged for a punitive damage which is another category (of) the juries (are) awarding damages these days based on the person's actual injuries and what they are due
sw4159.dff	54	B	And then they are awarding a second amount as punishment to the company which is usually a lot less
sw4159.dff	54	B	But it's an amount (their) designed to sting them a little (for) (their)
sw4159.dff	55	A	(That)
sw4159.dff	56	B	negligence
sw4159.dff	57	A	(For) (th-)
sw4159.dff	58	B	For gross wanton negligence in a claim
sw4159.dff	60	B	And unfortunately (the) lately the courts have been deciding that those could be paid for by insurance too
sw4159.dff	62	B	So again it never really penalizes
sw4159.dff	63	A	(That) (will)
sw4159.dff	64	B	the company doing the wrong
sw4159.dff	64	B	They can go on doing the same old thing they always used to
sw4159.dff	66	B	And if they know some practice is wrong I'm not talking about your isolated occurrences I'm talking more about (you) (know) the thing that they know maybe they're willfully manufacturing something that they know is hurting people out there and they continue to do it even after they become aware
sw4159.dff	67	A	(Sure)
sw4159.dff	68	B	of that
sw4159.dff	69	A	(Okay)
sw4159.dff	70	B	Then I think they ought to have to pay something out of their own pocket
sw4165.dff	17	A	you don't want to have thirty or forty kids and only one adult
sw4165.dff	17	A	Then
sw4165.dff	19	A	something happens and the adult wouldn't be able to accommodate or take care of the kids very well
sw4165.dff	21	A	And they also want to make sure that the kids are being taught and not just playing around all the time
sw4165.dff	21	A	(So) depends also upon the level of the child
sw4165.dff	21	A	we take a very close look at finding a good preschool for our kid
sw4165.dff	23	A	And I kind of relate (that) to that in making sure that the teachers are very well educated themselves
sw4165.dff	23	A	They have a good curriculum and that they're willing to teach the kids and have a fun time with them
sw4165.dff	23	A	And it's very important I feel that the kids interact with other children also
sw4165.dff	23	A	it's a good way to develop
sw4165.dff	25	A	relationships with other kids their age and get to know and work with kids
sw4165.dff	25	A	(So)
sw4165.dff	25	A	(I) (don't) (know)
sw4165.dff	25	A	I guess we're kind of in the same boat
sw4165.dff	25	A	We haven't had to look very carefully for child care
sw4165.dff	26	B	I kind of think that some of our friends or even our own children will be in a situation where they may need to look for child care
sw4165.dff	28	B	But even (here)
sw4165.dff	28	B	I guess we have in one sense two forms of child care
sw4165.dff	28	B	There's where individuals will in one primarily babysit
sw4165.dff	30	B	children in their own home
sw4165.dff	30	B	And that will be groups of anywhere from one or two to (maybe) seven or eight children
sw4165.dff	32	B	And then otherwise there will be the majority are co-operative day-cares
sw4165.dff	32	B	people form a co-op and parents will work in the co-op and put a fair number of hours
sw4165.dff	32	B	Frequently they will hire staff to be at the day-care and the emphasis is primarily someplace for the children to be
sw4165.dff	34	B	But at the same time there's some fairly good training programs and some of them formal two year programs
sw4165.dff	36	B	so that there is some definite creative play good social interaction that kind of thing
sw4165.dff	37	A	(I) (think) (it's) (important)
sw4165.dff	37	A	(Like) (you) (mentioned) that's a good idea on the parent co-op because I'm very concerned about the welfare of my kids and I don't want to just take them to somebody I pick out of the yellow pages or out of some ad somewhere
sw4165.dff	37	A	I want to trust the people
sw4165.dff	39	A	And you hear on the T V and you read the newspaper quite often of people that don't treat or take care of your kids the way you think they ought to be taken care of And hope to never get into that situation (where) (we) (have) (to) (find) (somebody) (and) (we) (have) (to) (trust) (someone) (with) (the) (welfare) (of) (our) (children)
sw4165.dff	39	A	And hope that we can stay in this situation for awhile
sw4165.dff	39	A	(So)
sw4165.dff	40	B	we've even had some of those (kinds) (of) situations publicized here
sw4165.dff	42	B	and (I) (guess) it's typically whether it's been child care in a home
sw4165.dff	44	B	or in a larger situation where actually it's more of an institution
sw4165.dff	44	B	And you've actually got children that most people would consider problem children and it's more of a group home rather than
sw4165.dff	46	B	actually day-care type of facility
sw4165.dff	47	A	(That's) (true) (that's) (true)
sw4165.dff	49	A	Steven it's been
sw4166.dff	2	A	(Okay)
sw4166.dff	2	A	before a couple of years ago I had a very narrow view of nursing homes and it was more like a funeral home
sw4166.dff	2	A	I always joked around about it being a funeral home and not really a nursing home
sw4166.dff	2	A	And then I had to do some volunteer work here in Tyler Texas and I went to one and it just had a very good activities director
sw4166.dff	2	A	Everyone was cheerful and now I don't have such a bad view of nursing homes anymore
sw4166.dff	2	A	But I certainly wouldn't want to send my parent unless it was an absolute last resort
sw4166.dff	2	A	I have a sister that is in nursing school and she's real interested in geriatrics
sw4166.dff	3	B	(that) (sounds) (good)
sw4166.dff	4	A	she's real interested in what Ann Richards has been doing
sw4166.dff	4	A	Ann Richards is really cracking down on the nursing homes and you wouldn't know anything about a Texas governor
sw4166.dff	5	B	I've heard the name and that's about all it goes
sw4166.dff	6	A	(Okay)
sw4166.dff	6	A	Ann Richards is our governor in Texas and she's really cracking down on restrictions and what goes on in nursing homes
sw4166.dff	6	A	And my sister's real interested in that and getting into that side of nursing
sw4166.dff	7	B	That's one problem with the nursing home environment
sw4166.dff	7	B	the elderly even out of the nursing home are very open to abuse
sw4166.dff	9	B	they don't always have their full wits about them
sw4166.dff	11	B	(They're) (not) (completely) (up) (on) (what) (should) (be) (going) (on) (or) (what's) (not) (going) (on)
sw4166.dff	13	B	And it can be pretty sad
sw4166.dff	13	B	I've had a grandmother who had a stroke
sw4166.dff	13	B	And she was in a nursing home for four or five years before she died
sw4166.dff	15	B	And it's the type of thing that she was living down in Florida
sw4166.dff	15	B	My families was up in Maryland
sw4166.dff	17	B	and the other part of her family was up in New York state
sw4166.dff	19	B	(And) it was very difficult for (either) them or my grandfather to take care of her since she (you) (know) could not do very much for herself after the stroke
sw4166.dff	21	B	(And) the nursing home was the best facility to put her in
sw4166.dff	23	B	(besides) (moving) (her) (up) which is not a practical solution since both my parents (work) and (both) (my) aunts and uncle (work)
sw4166.dff	25	B	(Which) (means) (it's) (very) (difficult) (for) (some-) you essentially need to have someone taking care of the person full-time
sw4166.dff	27	B	(And) there's also a lot of medical problems that can't always be completely handled in the home
sw4166.dff	29	B	Which makes it (it's) a necessary evil (I) (think)
sw4166.dff	30	A	(It) (sure) (is)
sw4166.dff	30	A	(And) some of the really nice ones that (really) take care of their people are so expensive
sw4166.dff	30	A	Because
sw4166.dff	32	A	(cause) they can afford to hire the people that are (really) going to care for the older
sw4166.dff	33	B	And even there you have to watch out for you get one person who's a little bit dishonest working in there (and) the elderly sometimes have a lot of jewelry
sw4166.dff	35	B	and other stuff that just very easily tends to disappear in the nursing homes
sw4166.dff	36	A	My grandfather passed away several years ago
sw4166.dff	36	A	I was much younger
sw4166.dff	36	A	But he was in the nursing home the last several years of his life and someone visited him every day
sw4166.dff	36	A	My grandmother did
sw4166.dff	36	A	But if she couldn't someone visited him every day
sw4166.dff	36	A	It was in a very small town nursing home
sw4166.dff	38	A	And people didn't get paid much there at all
sw4166.dff	38	A	They didn't care about what went on
sw4166.dff	40	A	They would let a patient get a lot of bed sores
sw4166.dff	42	A	And the people living in the nursing home would have all kinds of needs that wouldn't get met because they were just old people
sw4166.dff	42	A	(And) then the nurses and doctors really didn't put forth any loving care for them
sw4166.dff	43	B	Either that or they're just so understaffed that they can't afford
sw4166.dff	45	B	to put in the care that they need
sw4166.dff	47	B	Cause (it's) an elderly person (can) it's like a newborn baby
sw4166.dff	47	B	You need
sw4166.dff	49	B	to have twenty-four hour care
sw4166.dff	51	B	answering all the needs cause they can't do much for themselves at certain points
sw4166.dff	52	A	And nurses get so worn down
sw4166.dff	53	B	And there's a number of the elderly are very complaining because they remember the way that things used to be
sw4166.dff	55	B	And remember being able to do things for themselves which they no longer can
sw4166.dff	56	A	(sure)
sw4166.dff	56	A	(And) (they) (feel)
sw4166.dff	57	B	And it very (very) hard for them to accept that
sw4166.dff	58	A	they feel pretty helpless
sw4166.dff	59	B	We just moved my grandfather into not a nursing home but a transitional type facility
sw4166.dff	60	A	Is it like a retirement center
sw4166.dff	61	B	More of a retirement home
sw4166.dff	61	B	He's got his own efficiency apartment
sw4166.dff	63	B	(And) they provide one meal a day
sw4166.dff	65	B	(And) the rest of the housekeeping and other meals a day are up to him
sw4166.dff	67	B	But they do have group activities going on
sw4166.dff	68	A	How's he handling that
sw4166.dff	69	B	he'd much rather be living alone in his apartment down in Florida
sw4166.dff	71	B	(to) (move) (into) (that) (facility) we moved him (from) (Florida) up to Maryland and
sw4166.dff	73	B	it's a bit of a shock to the system weather-wise if nothing else
sw4166.dff	74	A	(sure)
sw4166.dff	74	A	There wasn't anything like that that you could do in Florida
sw4166.dff	75	B	there was (stuff) (like) (that) (in) (Florida) but
sw4168.dff	23	A	what's the old country music like
sw4168.dff	24	B	(like) (Hank) (Williams)
sw4168.dff	24	B	Like the old Hank Williams
sw4168.dff	24	B	(even) (Hank)
sw4168.dff	26	B	(Williams) Junior is real good stuff
sw4168.dff	26	B	The kind that
sw4168.dff	27	A	(okay)
sw4168.dff	28	B	(this) (stuff)
sw4168.dff	30	B	makes you cry it sounds so sad
sw4168.dff	30	B	(you) (d-)
sw4168.dff	31	A	That's the kind you like you mean
sw4168.dff	32	B	sometimes I do
sw4168.dff	32	B	not all the time
sw4168.dff	33	A	(okay)
sw4168.dff	35	A	(I) (guess) I like the blues a lot and (I) (guess) you could say it's similar as far as
sw4168.dff	36	B	(Yes)
sw4168.dff	36	B	(And) (I)
sw4168.dff	37	A	the way they do it
sw4168.dff	38	B	I (I) do too
sw4168.dff	38	B	I also like jazz
sw4168.dff	39	A	Me too
sw4168.dff	39	A	(I) (guess) I like except heavy metal and most rap I don't like
sw4168.dff	40	B	you're about like I am then
sw4168.dff	40	B	I can't
sw4168.dff	42	B	watch M T V anymore
sw4168.dff	42	B	I used to love M T V
sw4168.dff	43	A	(okay)
sw4168.dff	44	B	And I can barely watch anymore because they have this heavy metal stuff on there and (you) (know) I can't like that
sw4168.dff	46	B	and I liked Aerosmith and
sw4168.dff	48	B	Led Zepplin and
sw4168.dff	49	A	(Okay)
sw4168.dff	50	B	(and) (jeez) (who) (else) (is) (there)
sw4168.dff	50	B	Van Halen
sw4168.dff	51	A	(Okay)
sw4168.dff	52	B	I like groups like that
sw4168.dff	52	B	(But) (when) (you) (get) I even like Guns and Roses some of their stuff
sw4168.dff	54	B	But some of these groups now like Slaughter
sw4168.dff	55	A	(I) (really) (haven't) (listened) (to) (that)
sw4168.dff	56	B	Some of them are just really rough
sw4168.dff	56	B	(so) (you) (went) (to) (school) (then) (in) I'm surprised you didn't go to any parties or anything where they were playing a lot of music or stuff (or)
sw4168.dff	57	A	I used to a long time ago but since I've started back into school now I haven't really done that much
sw4168.dff	57	A	I've been pretty busy
sw4168.dff	58	B	(Okay)
sw4168.dff	59	A	(but) so no I haven't
sw4168.dff	59	A	(you) (know) I used to go out and dance a lot but I don't do that anymore either
sw4168.dff	60	B	(I) (see)
sw4168.dff	60	B	Are you married at all
sw4168.dff	61	A	No
sw4168.dff	62	B	(Okay)
sw4168.dff	63	A	I've just been real busy with lots of other things
sw4168.dff	64	B	how old are you
sw4168.dff	65	A	Twenty-eight
sw4168.dff	66	B	(Okay)
sw4168.dff	66	B	you went to school for awhile and quit
sw4168.dff	66	B	Then went back
sw4168.dff	67	A	no
sw4168.dff	67	A	I went to school and got a degree and then I worked for awhile
sw4168.dff	67	A	And then I started back a year and a half ago
sw4168.dff	67	A	Changed directions
sw4168.dff	68	B	(okay)
sw4168.dff	69	A	How old are you
sw4168.dff	70	B	I'm twenty-eight
sw4168.dff	70	B	I was born in sixty-three
sw4168.dff	70	B	(I) (guess) (we're)
sw4168.dff	71	A	(okay)
sw4168.dff	71	A	(All)
sw4168.dff	72	B	the same age then
sw4168.dff	73	A	And I didn't really start getting into music until I went to college because my parents didn't really have music in the house
sw4168.dff	73	A	Put it that way
sw4168.dff	74	B	rea- Were they religious
sw4168.dff	75	A	Yes
sw4168.dff	76	B	I see
sw4168.dff	76	B	(I)
sw4168.dff	77	A	I'm always behind
sw4168.dff	77	A	I'm never really up to date on all that stuff
sw4168.dff	77	A	But I know what I like when I like a sound
sw4168.dff	77	A	(A) (certain) (kind) (of) (sound)
sw4168.dff	100	B	(okay)
sw4168.dff	101	A	But I like the early seventies late sixties rock
sw4168.dff	102	B	(okay)
sw4168.dff	103	A	Kind of stuff the old stuff
sw4168.dff	103	A	(And)
sw4168.dff	104	B	(so) (do) (I)
sw4168.dff	106	B	Do you like Van Halen or anything like that
sw4168.dff	106	B	Or how about Brian Adams
sw4168.dff	107	A	(Bri-) what kind of music (is) (does) what
sw4168.dff	108	B	(it)
sw4168.dff	109	A	songs does he play
sw4168.dff	110	B	THIS LOVE CUTS LIKE A KNIFE
sw4168.dff	112	B	SUMMER OF SIXTY-NINE
sw4168.dff	113	A	I think I've heard SUMMER OF SIXTY-NINE
sw4168.dff	114	B	(He) (sings) (that)
sw4168.dff	116	B	he's from Canada
sw4168.dff	117	A	(Okay)
sw4168.dff	117	A	I'm not very good at remembering the
sw4168.dff	118	B	(The) titles and artists
sw4168.dff	119	A	titles but I can remember the song
sw4168.dff	120	B	do
sw4168.dff	122	B	(do) you watch music television M T V at all
sw4168.dff	122	B	Or V H One
sw4168.dff	123	A	No I don't watch T V much at all
sw4168.dff	124	B	(Okay)
sw4168.dff	126	B	do you get cable
sw4168.dff	127	A	No
sw4168.dff	128	B	(okay)
sw4168.dff	128	B	(that's)
sw4168.dff	129	A	(No)
sw4168.dff	130	B	you have to get cable to get those stations anyhow
sw4168.dff	132	B	But I like to watch rock and roll videos and any kind of videos
sw4168.dff	134	B	I like watching that kind of thing
sw4168.dff	134	B	(It's)
sw4168.dff	135	A	Do you like someone recent
sw4168.dff	135	A	Like Enya
sw4168.dff	135	A	Have you ever head of her
sw4168.dff	135	A	She's not rock (but)
sw4168.dff	136	B	No I haven't heard her
sw4168.dff	137	A	she's from Ireland
sw4168.dff	138	B	(okay)
sw4168.dff	139	A	And she's been on the top ten (I) (guess) (or) (whatever)
sw4168.dff	140	B	(really)
sw4168.dff	141	A	(she) (did)
sw4174.dff	1	A	(Okay)
sw4174.dff	2	B	(Okay) Mark our situation is that we do have a daughter that is in the situation of choosing college
sw4174.dff	4	B	She's actually at Bible College for this current year
sw4174.dff	6	B	And (I) (guess) first and foremost (really) it's a question of what the student wants to have in the way of a career and then which colleges or universities can best offer that program and then it comes down to the dollar
sw4174.dff	6	B	(You) (have) (to) it's whether or not you're a resident for that jurisdiction or
sw4174.dff	8	B	(it) (does) it comes down to
sw4174.dff	10	B	trying to come with a trade off of the costs
sw4174.dff	12	B	(what) (do) (you) (feel) (about) (come) (of) (the) (things) (that) (need) (to)
sw4174.dff	13	A	(Damn) (it) () (I) (agree) (pretty) (much) (with) (everything) (you've) (said)
sw4174.dff	13	A	the one thing that (you) (know) I'd advise any parent or any person looking for a college is that I think it's really important for them to actually visit the college and actually try and get away from the guided tour of the college and try and talk to the actual students there because (they're) (just) in my experience I've talked to people at other colleges that the lifestyle pictured in the catalogs isn't always the whole story
sw4174.dff	14	B	(No) (y-) (the) (college) the catalogs are sales material
sw4174.dff	16	B	It doesn't matter
sw4174.dff	18	B	whether they're selling school
sw4174.dff	20	B	and true it really is helpful if a parent and the student can get there and see
sw4174.dff	22	B	the real character (of) (the) (school) and the real life experiences of the school
sw4174.dff	22	B	(I) (guess) (there's) (a) (difference) (in) (here) (the) (at) (least)
sw4174.dff	24	B	the university (here) in Saskatoon is primarily off campus resident students
sw4174.dff	24	B	they just live in the community
sw4174.dff	26	B	I know that there are a lot of colleges and universities particularly as they get to be a little bit on the smaller side where dormitory life (is) is on campus as well
sw4174.dff	28	B	and (you) (know) that changes the character
sw4174.dff	30	B	of it quite a bit
sw4174.dff	31	A	I go to Georgia Tech which is primarily an engineering school
sw4174.dff	33	A	and I think I really do miss the fact that it's not a university (that) (there's) (not) (the) it tends to be a very conservative school and there doesn't seem to be the diversity of views that a lot of universities will have
sw4174.dff	34	B	(I) (guess) (we're) (here) this is the university that has for years had the car that will travel the farthest on a small quantity of gas our engineering students
sw4174.dff	36	B	in competitions and that's the kind of thing that also if you can see the kinds of achievements that have been made by students as well as graduates
sw4174.dff	38	B	can give you idea of the character of the school
sw4174.dff	38	B	whether you've got a spirit of innovation and excellence or whether you've got a spirit of somewhat unkind but
sw4174.dff	40	B	producing graduates
sw4174.dff	42	B	as sort of some development and some training it's easy enough to crank out graduates but to really challenge them
sw4174.dff	44	B	and that can vary between colleges and faculties even as to (you) (know) what the attitude towards achievement is
sw4174.dff	46	B	do you have anyone that you're seriously needing to feed information to
sw4174.dff	46	B	I suppose if you're actually at Georgia Tech as a student you're a ways away from that
sw4174.dff	47	A	I don't really know of anyone that's looking for colleges now with the exception of people's younger brothers and sisters
sw4174.dff	47	A	Then the only advise passed down is don't go to Georgia Tech
sw4174.dff	49	A	but no actually I'm more interested in choosing the job when you graduate
sw4174.dff	51	A	type information
sw4174.dff	52	B	that's really a valid point that people need
sw4174.dff	54	B	to consider as well
sw4174.dff	56	B	(to) going to university is going to take four to eight years depending on the
sw4174.dff	57	A	(Program)
sw4174.dff	58	B	programs person's involved in and after that you have to be out in the real world and have to be able to support yourself
sw4174.dff	60	B	and if you go in an area that there is just not much of a job market
sw4174.dff	62	B	(jeez) (if) (that's)
sw4174.dff	63	A	like a fine arts education (I)
sw4174.dff	64	B	Best training in the world is not going to put food on your table
sw4174.dff	66	B	(But)
sw4175.dff	1	A	(I) (don't) (believe) (that) (we're)
sw4175.dff	2	B	what do you think about recycling programs in Atlanta Julie
sw4175.dff	3	A	The recycling program here is just terrible
sw4175.dff	3	A	it's hard to find places to go
sw4175.dff	3	A	Kroger does a couple things
sw4175.dff	3	A	do they do newspapers
sw4175.dff	4	B	I don't know there's big bins out there (I) (don't) (know) (if) (they) (ever) (get) I really don't know what the details are
sw4175.dff	4	B	There should be someplace where you could call and find out
sw4175.dff	4	B	As a matter of fact I'm pretty sure there's a place you can call and find out the closest thing to you but I think there should be some kind of curbside service
sw4175.dff	6	B	(That's) (the) (only) (way) (I) (could) (really)
sw4175.dff	7	A	The one in Florida is so cool because they pick up everything
sw4175.dff	7	A	They pick up newspapers and milk jugs and aluminum and tin cans like soup comes in and stuff
sw4175.dff	9	A	(They) (pick) (up) (everything)
sw4175.dff	10	B	During the summers around where I live the homeless people (see-) (they) all have shopping carts and
sw4175.dff	12	B	stuff and they're go around and collect cans
sw4175.dff	14	B	and aluminum (and) (stuff) and so we used to just save them up and then they'd come around and we'd give them to them
sw4175.dff	16	B	But when during the winter time I think they move south or something
sw4175.dff	18	B	so I don't do that anymore
sw4175.dff	18	B	And the recycling at Georgia Tech like that outside the student center
sw4175.dff	20	B	they never empty those things
sw4175.dff	21	A	(I) (know) (it) (I) (know) (it)
sw4175.dff	22	B	They just overflow
sw4175.dff	23	A	It piles up
sw4175.dff	24	B	(what's) (a) (guy) (to) (do)
sw4175.dff	29	A	I just don't know
sw4175.dff	30	B	(I) (asked) (myself)
sw4175.dff	31	A	(I) (just) (don't) (know) (and) now they have bins and stuff that are a little more convenient because until seven o'clock you got to pay to park at the student center you can't really unload all your stuff
sw4175.dff	32	B	Really
sw4175.dff	32	B	that's true hadn't thought about that
sw4175.dff	32	B	That is very inconvenient
sw4175.dff	34	B	(Inconvenient) (even)
sw4175.dff	35	A	I know it (I) (know) (it)
sw4175.dff	36	B	But you do recycle don't you
sw4175.dff	38	B	I'm kind of bad about it
sw4175.dff	39	A	(The)
sw4175.dff	40	B	if I see a pile of cans or bottles or something
sw4175.dff	42	B	I'll throw it in there but I don't ever take anything
sw4175.dff	43	A	(it's) (real) you ought to because the farmer's market recycles absolutely everything
sw4175.dff	45	A	And since we go there all the time
sw4175.dff	46	B	(But) (wait)
sw4175.dff	47	A	(probably) (at) (all)
sw4175.dff	48	B	I've never seen you before
sw4175.dff	50	B	Who are you
sw4175.dff	51	A	by the way may name's Julie
sw4175.dff	52	B	my name's Bill
sw4175.dff	53	A	Hi
sw4175.dff	54	B	Hi
sw4175.dff	55	A	I'm from Atlanta
sw4175.dff	56	B	Me too
sw4175.dff	57	A	(Neat)
sw4175.dff	58	B	(Crazy)
sw4175.dff	60	B	is there anything else you'd like to share me about your recycling philosophy Julie
sw4175.dff	61	A	I just think that everybody ought to do it
sw4175.dff	62	B	(Do) (they) (do) (what) (about) what kind of plastic stuff can you recycle do you know
sw4175.dff	63	A	The only thing I know that you can recycle is milk jugs
sw4175.dff	64	B	Really
sw4175.dff	66	B	What about like those grocery bags
sw4175.dff	67	A	(they) (have) (what) (I) (used) (to) now that I don't go to the grocery store much it's kind of moot but I used to just save up the ones that I got one time
sw4175.dff	69	A	and then go and hand them to them the next time and use them over and over
sw4175.dff	71	A	but also most places like Big Star does and I'm not sure if Kroger does or not (but)
sw4175.dff	72	B	They'll ask you whether you want bags or paper or plastic
sw4175.dff	73	A	and they have little boxes that you can put your old bags in
sw4175.dff	75	A	(Can) (bring) (them) (in)
sw4175.dff	76	B	Those petroleum products are going to kill us
sw4175.dff	77	A	I know it (I) (know) (it)
sw4175.dff	78	B	The hostile planet I think
sw4175.dff	80	B	Julie
sw4175.dff	81	A	It really is a small
sw4175.dff	83	A	(hostile) (planet)
sw4175.dff	84	B	I mean those petroleum products I think are (the) (big)
sw4175.dff	85	A	(Did) (you) (know) (that)
sw4175.dff	86	B	the great Satan of the recycling
sw4175.dff	87	A	No really not
sw4175.dff	87	A	Did you know that something like fifty percent of the world's landfills is paper
sw4175.dff	89	A	(Filled) (with) (paper)
sw4175.dff	90	B	Paper just seems so innocuous
sw4175.dff	92	B	Paper doesn't seem threatening at all
sw4175.dff	93	A	it is though
sw4175.dff	94	B	It comes from trees
sw4175.dff	94	B	How can it be bad
sw4175.dff	95	A	(It) (is) (because) (they)
sw4175.dff	96	B	They treat it with chemicals or something
sw4175.dff	96	B	Why can't trees break down
sw4175.dff	96	B	I don't get it
sw4175.dff	97	A	they do treat paper with chemicals yellow paper
sw4175.dff	99	A	takes something like twenty times as long to decompose
sw4175.dff	101	A	you can bury a piece of yellow paper it will still be there in a couple of weeks
sw4175.dff	102	B	Really
sw4175.dff	105	A	it will be whole
sw4175.dff	105	A	You'll be able to read
sw4175.dff	106	B	I'm going to switch
sw4175.dff	107	A	off of it
sw4175.dff	108	B	from those yellow legal pads then
sw4175.dff	110	B	I'm glad you told me that because I use those (at) (work) where I work and
sw4175.dff	112	B	But I can just
sw4175.dff	113	A	(W-)
sw4175.dff	114	B	forget that from now on
sw4175.dff	114	B	I'm going to switch to the white ones
sw4175.dff	115	A	white paper's bad too
sw4175.dff	115	A	they treat it too
sw4175.dff	116	B	what about papyrus made out of you know bamboo stuff from the
sw4175.dff	117	A	(I'm) (sure) (that's) (fine)
sw4175.dff	118	B	(from) (the)
sw4175.dff	119	A	(I'm) (sure)
sw4175.dff	120	B	banks of the Nile
sw4175.dff	121	A	Maybe we ought to just start carving in stone again
sw4175.dff	122	B	You think so
sw4175.dff	123	A	Maybe
sw4175.dff	124	B	Tablets
sw4175.dff	126	B	I think we should just abandon (you) (know) the written word
sw4175.dff	127	A	You think
sw4175.dff	128	B	altogether
sw4175.dff	129	A	I don't know
sw4175.dff	130	B	What do you think
sw4175.dff	131	A	I think we've (kind) (of) (everybody) (everybody)
sw4175.dff	132	B	(Kind) (of) (radical) (I) (know) (but)
sw4175.dff	133	A	everybody has a computer
sw4175.dff	135	A	We would no longer need
sw4175.dff	136	B	(That's) (true)
sw4175.dff	137	A	paper at all
sw4175.dff	138	B	Everyone had a two way wrist watch T V -s on their wrist
sw4175.dff	140	B	like Dick Tracy
sw4175.dff	141	A	I would love that
sw4177.dff	1	A	(Hi)
sw4177.dff	1	A	do you think you get good coverage from the sources that you have
sw4177.dff	2	B	actually no because I'm in school
sw4177.dff	2	B	I (kind) (of) miss out on most (of) (the) current events
sw4177.dff	2	B	I just catch the major ones off the news or if someone starts to talk about it
sw4177.dff	3	A	Do you watch a lot of T V to get the news then
sw4177.dff	4	B	I don't watch a lot of it but (that's) (the) (on-) basically that's my only major source of information
sw4177.dff	6	B	what about you
sw4177.dff	7	A	(I) (read) (I) (get) (a) (bunch) (of) (different) (things)
sw4177.dff	7	A	I get a newspaper every day and I try to at least have a few minutes to look through that and (I) (look) (through) I get a NEWSWEEK (every) (week) which I pretty much read that cover to cover and (I) (as) (far) (as) that satisfies most of the short term news I get
sw4177.dff	7	A	don't watch much T V (don't) (have) (enough) (time) and don't listen to the radio too much especially the news channels (or) (anything) (like) (that) they might give you (a) little blurbs like
sw4177.dff	9	A	(this) (happened) (or) (that) (happened) (and) (that's) (about) (all) (I) (ever) (hear) (of) (it)
sw4177.dff	9	A	(but) most of my news probably comes from NEWSWEEK (and) (for) (the) (longer) (term) (I) (read) SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN (and) READERS' DIGEST and some of those other types of magazines that (come) (out) (which) (they) the news isn't immediate what you'd generally think of as news but it's recent material
sw4177.dff	10	B	And it's more in depth
sw4177.dff	11	A	(it) (is) (more) (in) (depth) less broad
sw4177.dff	11	A	(it's) (probably) (isn't) (less) (broad) (but) (it's) (just) (more) (in) (depth) (and) it is more just significant information It is the big events not the little events
sw4177.dff	13	A	Not the fact that there was a big auto accident down on the corner of Broad and Main
sw4177.dff	14	B	(I) (know) (where) they're just trying to fill in
sw4177.dff	15	A	(Yes) (or) they're making time (because) (they) to fill in an hour's worth of news
sw4177.dff	17	A	I get (kind) (of) bored watching T V (actually) when I watch the news (on) (T) (V) (because)
sw4177.dff	18	B	(I) (know) I do too
sw4177.dff	19	A	it goes so slow and (then) there's nothing that (really) is so exciting
sw4177.dff	20	B	you may find one little news item interesting so you have to wait twenty minutes to hear about it
sw4177.dff	21	A	that's about what it ends up being
sw4177.dff	21	A	Listen to the news to hear the traffic report or something
sw4177.dff	22	B	you mention NEWSWEEK I do like U S NEWS AND WORLD REPORT
sw4177.dff	22	B	I don't get to read it as much as I like but (I) (think) that's a good magazine
sw4177.dff	23	A	I think they're about the same
sw4177.dff	23	A	(they) (certainly) (have) (a) (very) (similar) (charter) (at) (least) (in) (my) (mind)
sw4177.dff	23	A	(And) what kind of news normally interests you (what) (do) (you) (find) (interesting)
sw4177.dff	25	A	versus what do you find boring
sw4177.dff	26	B	now trying to keep abreast of what's going on in Europe with all the U S S R's satellites breaking off trying to become independent and European community coming together
sw4177.dff	28	B	That's going to affect our economy quite a bit
sw4177.dff	29	A	I think it will they keep claiming it's going to have a big influence but we've yet to see it (and) (th-) it's real short term yet though it's only been three months or something like that
sw4177.dff	31	A	since that happened
sw4177.dff	33	A	But they like to tell us that it's going to be important
sw4177.dff	34	B	I'm pretty sure it is because
sw4177.dff	35	A	(I) (think) (it) (is) (too)
sw4177.dff	36	B	once Europe becomes unified and their economy becomes one big economy we're going to be kind of hurting
sw4177.dff	37	A	I think that's a possibility we might also be helped though because it will be easier to do business over there too
sw4177.dff	38	B	(definitely)
sw4177.dff	39	A	For the companies that already have a presence over there and I know of at least one company that specifically went over there and established a presence before nineteen ninety-two so that they would have it when it
sw4177.dff	41	A	came time
sw4177.dff	42	B	(so) (they) (have) (a) (toe) (hold) (I) (good) (toe) hold
sw4177.dff	43	A	Because once you're in there then you can easily expand
sw4177.dff	43	A	But getting in after nineteen ninety-two is more difficult
sw4177.dff	44	B	because when they first start off they're going to be highly protectionist
sw4177.dff	45	A	Yes
sw4177.dff	47	A	And there's already a lot of evidence that they are being very protectionist even amongst themselves (they're) (being) (somewhat) (protectionist)
sw4177.dff	49	A	England doesn't want to do one thing and Sweden doesn't want to do other thing and they've all got their own reasons which have to be resolved yet
sw4177.dff	51	A	And some of it is I'm sure within those people's minds it's quite justified
sw4177.dff	52	B	I can understand their viewpoint they're starting off their economy's a little bit weak so you want to
sw4177.dff	54	B	get established before they
sw4177.dff	55	A	(Before) (they)
sw4177.dff	56	B	(com-)
sw4177.dff	57	A	open up their borders to everyone
sw4177.dff	58	B	totally
sw4177.dff	59	A	what (is) (the) do you watch anything with sports or anything like that
sw4177.dff	60	B	I'm not really into sports
sw4177.dff	60	B	My roommates are so unfortunately I forced to watch quite a bit of sports
sw4177.dff	63	A	(Against) (your) (will)
sw4177.dff	64	B	we have to fight over the remote control
sw4177.dff	65	A	at least you guys have a remote control
sw4177.dff	67	A	It's sometimes better to not have one of those
sw4177.dff	67	A	Course you can always mislocate it
sw4177.dff	69	A	misplace it and
sw4181.dff	1	A	I don't think anybody pays too little
sw4181.dff	2	B	No I would tend to agree very highly
sw4181.dff	2	B	I think that we're all paying a little bit too much taxes and not seeing too much good come out of it
sw4181.dff	3	A	Do you get hit up for local taxes there
sw4181.dff	4	B	we sure do
sw4181.dff	4	B	Here in Indiana we pay county income tax state income tax we pay five percent sales tax you name it they tax it
sw4181.dff	5	A	so you get the whole smorgasbord
sw4181.dff	6	B	(That's) (we)
sw4181.dff	7	A	I actually live in New Hampshire
sw4181.dff	9	A	tax free or die
sw4181.dff	12	B	Which is probably pretty nice but I'll bet that means your state sales tax is pretty high
sw4181.dff	13	A	No actually there's no sales tax in New Hampshire either
sw4181.dff	14	B	There's no sales tax either
sw4181.dff	15	A	No what there is is very high property taxes because that's how they fund schools (and) (everything)
sw4181.dff	17	A	The only problem is I work in Massachusetts so they
sw4181.dff	19	A	they hit me up for the five percent there
sw4181.dff	20	B	Taxachusetts
sw4181.dff	21	A	(but) (it) (we) it's only a state tax here no local
sw4181.dff	23	A	We've got a five percent sales tax
sw4181.dff	25	A	(But) the problem is that I'm paying state tax even if I don't live here
sw4181.dff	27	A	(But) at least on things like stock options (and) (things) (like) (that) they don't tax me
sw4181.dff	29	A	So that's not too bad
sw4181.dff	30	B	(No) I really think that here in Indiana at least we pay just too much tax
sw4181.dff	30	B	I worked in a factory last summer and on the average I was losing twenty percent of every paycheck to taxes and I don't feel that I really get a whole lot of return from that
sw4181.dff	30	B	I don't utilize (you) (know) (it) really any government welfare services
sw4181.dff	30	B	Of course I drive on the roads and I went to (the) schools (and) (stuff) but I really feel that I'm just getting overtaxed
sw4181.dff	31	A	I'd consider twenty percent lucky because (I) (mean) (you) (know) when you figure out just on feds I actually hit the thirty-one bracket
sw4181.dff	33	A	this year which was no fun
sw4181.dff	34	B	No that's
sw4181.dff	36	B	that's not any fun
sw4181.dff	37	A	(and) also then you figure out seven or eight percent for F I C A
sw4181.dff	39	A	which is taxes
sw4181.dff	41	A	(where) (you) most people forget about them because (you) (know) you can't always get your F I C A back at the end of the year
sw4181.dff	43	A	(you) (know) (and) then a five percent surtax I'm paying forty percent tax
sw4181.dff	44	B	which is just outrageous and a lot (of) (it) and if you look at the way the government is run these days it just seems like a lot of it's going to waste
sw4181.dff	45	A	I think there certainly are some things where you need infrastructure (and) (you) (need)
sw4181.dff	57	A	(we)
sw4181.dff	58	B	instead of real good programs
sw4181.dff	59	A	we spend a fortune for things like V A hospitals and then you look at how well they're managed I don't think we're getting our money's worth out of there
sw4181.dff	59	A	I think it's all going into bureaucrats
sw4181.dff	60	B	and a lot of it's feeding that
sw4181.dff	60	B	especially in the election year I'm really thinking a lot about this the economy and questions like that and just (the) (whole) it seems like everything is really screwy now as far as the government goes and our whole economy in general and our taxes just are going to keep rising no matter what happens and especially when you've got the Bush administration who has increased government expenditures beyond what any other President since World War Two has done (and) (yet)
sw4181.dff	61	A	(be-)
sw4181.dff	62	B	(he) (supposedly)
sw4181.dff	63	A	(between) (him) (and) (Reagan)
sw4181.dff	65	A	(The) (great) (communicator)
sw4181.dff	66	B	I just read something that two thirds or three quarters I'm not exactly sure of our national debt was created during the Reagan Bush era
sw4181.dff	67	A	(they) (think)
sw4181.dff	68	B	who are supposedly fiscally conservative
sw4181.dff	69	A	and then they go and say I'm not (c-) Congress they're the fault for it
sw4181.dff	71	A	But (the) (other) (thing) (is) it's tricky though like in New Hampshire they say all let's cut the military budget
sw4181.dff	73	A	then you lose half your jobs in New Hampshire
sw4181.dff	75	A	you lose Grotten Connecticut goes (you) (know) it's very tricky to balance that stuff off because then you hurt if people lose their jobs then they become a load and they're not contributing taxes
sw4181.dff	76	B	(That's)
sw4181.dff	77	A	it's very hard to say this is what we should cut
sw4181.dff	78	B	(it's) (really) (that) (is) (the) (especially) cuts in the defense is really a Catch twenty-two
sw4184.dff	25	A	(That's) (good)
sw4184.dff	27	A	(They) (say)
sw4184.dff	28	B	(And) they get along (real) good
sw4184.dff	28	B	I said if Tom could see dog lick this kitty he'd flip
sw4184.dff	30	B	(So) that was interesting
sw4184.dff	31	A	(Didn't) (expect) (that) (would) (happen)
sw4184.dff	31	A	(that's) (cool) (that's) (nice)
sw4184.dff	31	A	(let's) (see) what was the other dog you had
sw4184.dff	32	B	It's a sheltie
sw4184.dff	33	A	(a) (sheltie)
sw4184.dff	34	B	She's (real) sweet little dog
sw4184.dff	34	B	She's got a (very) nice temperament
sw4184.dff	34	B	they're not as aggressive as a Schnauzer
sw4184.dff	36	B	(the) (Schnauzers) (are) (a) (little) (aggressive)
sw4184.dff	37	A	They can be nippy
sw4184.dff	39	A	shelties are nice
sw4184.dff	39	A	Everybody seems to be (really) happy with them
sw4184.dff	39	A	They're good temperament
sw4184.dff	40	B	(They're) (a) (good) (temperament)
sw4184.dff	41	A	They put up with a lot
sw4184.dff	42	B	and (they) just they I think they have a good head on their shoulders
sw4184.dff	42	B	(I) (think) they have a higher level of intelligence than other dogs that I have encountered
sw4184.dff	43	A	Schnauzers in particular probably
sw4184.dff	46	B	(but) also some poodles
sw4184.dff	48	B	(they're) (kind) (of) there are some smart ones out there (but) (there's) also some not so smart ones
sw4184.dff	49	A	(I) (g-) it seems the smaller (the) (are) the worse off they are
sw4184.dff	50	B	(maybe) there's some credence in that statement
sw4184.dff	51	A	they're bred down so much
sw4184.dff	51	A	(It's)
sw4184.dff	53	A	They aren't the best pets
sw4184.dff	54	B	I (really) don't know
sw4184.dff	56	B	what the best pet is
sw4184.dff	56	B	(I) (guess) it's up to the individual and how they relate to their animal
sw4184.dff	57	A	some people seem fairly well suited for
sw4184.dff	59	A	(for) miniature poodles and such
sw4184.dff	60	B	And bull dogs
sw4184.dff	62	B	But I don't know about these (now) (what) (are) (they) (called)
sw4184.dff	62	B	pit bulls
sw4184.dff	63	A	(Pit) (bull)
sw4184.dff	64	B	that are (so) vicious
sw4184.dff	65	A	(They) (might) they're actually very friendly dogs
sw4184.dff	66	B	(Are) (they) (really)
sw4184.dff	66	B	(I) (don't) (think) (I've) (ever)
sw4184.dff	67	A	they're really nice
sw4184.dff	68	B	(seen) (one)
sw4184.dff	69	A	I've dealt with quite a few of them
sw4184.dff	69	A	customers that bring them into the shop and (ask) (me) they fit collars and stuff on them and they are (just) really nice really friendly (kind) (of) (like) medium intelligence
sw4184.dff	70	B	(how) (do) (they) (become) (s-) (w-) how did they get their reputation (then)
sw4184.dff	71	A	(because) (some) (people) (want) (to) (train) (them) (as)
sw4184.dff	72	B	(they) (train) (them) (to) (be) (that) (way) (then)
sw4184.dff	74	B	(okay)
sw4184.dff	75	A	You really can't get a pit bull from birth that's that way
sw4184.dff	76	B	(okay)
sw4184.dff	77	A	it takes a lot of training and a lot of abuse to get a dog to really
sw4184.dff	78	B	(dear) (so) (the)
sw4184.dff	79	A	respond
sw4184.dff	80	B	the poor animal is doing it in self protection
sw4184.dff	82	B	(dear)
sw4184.dff	83	A	they aren't by nature really nasty critters
sw4184.dff	83	A	They are very determined (critters)
sw4184.dff	85	A	and so once you get them going it's not good to deal with but I really like them
sw4184.dff	85	A	I was impressed by them
sw4184.dff	85	A	they're real sturdy little critters and they aren't that big
sw4184.dff	87	A	And just really friendly
sw4184.dff	88	B	(that's) (unusual)
sw4184.dff	89	A	I was
sw4184.dff	90	B	(I)
sw4184.dff	91	A	overwhelmed
sw4184.dff	92	B	(I) (suppose) (you) (were) (surprised)
sw4184.dff	96	B	After
sw4184.dff	97	A	(now)
sw4184.dff	98	B	the reputation that they have quite an notable reputation (as) (far) (as)
sw4184.dff	99	A	They picked up a lot of bad press lately
sw4184.dff	100	B	they're banned in some areas I understand
sw4184.dff	103	A	But any pet's can be bad if you train it to be that way
sw4184.dff	104	B	(that) they must have just targeted that breed (and) (said) (boy) (we're) (going)
sw4184.dff	105	A	(it's) (when) in my hometown they just outlawed ferrets
sw4184.dff	106	B	(okay)
sw4184.dff	107	A	because they had one incident of a ferret attacking a child
sw4184.dff	108	B	(okay)
sw4184.dff	109	A	in a house
sw4184.dff	111	A	these people had left this infant in the same room with this loose ferret
sw4184.dff	111	A	the ferret is used to running the house and was kind of wild
sw4184.dff	113	A	and they should expect something like that to happen
sw4184.dff	113	A	And so (bas-) now (it's) (like) ferrets are outlawed in the town
sw4184.dff	114	B	did it attack the child then
sw4184.dff	115	A	it bit him
sw4184.dff	117	A	And that was not a good thing but I think it was probably an individual ferret thing because it was a fairly wild ferret
sw4184.dff	118	B	(the)
sw4184.dff	119	A	(they) (hadn't)
sw4184.dff	120	B	the people that owned him should have been on the
sw4184.dff	122	B	lookout for that
sw4184.dff	123	A	they really should have expected it
sw4184.dff	125	A	And taken the precautions
sw4184.dff	125	A	They didn't
sw4184.dff	126	B	(Sure)
sw4184.dff	127	A	It's too bad it happened though
sw4184.dff	128	B	because then the animal's in trouble and not the person
